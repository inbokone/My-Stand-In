1
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,280
Joe, it's late.

2
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:39,880
Aren't you going to work today?

3
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,590
Sorry, Mom.

4
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,070
I couldn't really sleep last night.

5
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,360
So I woke up quite late.

6
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,030
Oh, why couldn't you sleep?

7
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,000
Are you alright?

8
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,670
I'm alright, Mom.

9
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,070
I'm just a little stressed out.

10
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,840
Maybe you shouldn't go to work today.

11
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,510
I've almost finished making breakfast.

12
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,960
It's alright, Mom.

13
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,400
I'll see you in the afternoon, alright?

14
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,550
Alright, off you go.

15
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,360
Yes, Mom.

16
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,800
I'm gonna get going now.

17
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,960
Did you forget something?

18
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,480
Mrs. Ing.

19
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,190
The debt,...it's been put off for a while.

20
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,190
And...the keys.

21
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,440
You just happened to be there when I got there that day.

22
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,630
It's just like that.

23
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,070
I won't be fooled by you anymore.

24
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,110
Joe.

25
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,760
What's wrong?

26
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,510
Nothing.

27
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,550
I thought you're better now.

28
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,630
Are you working too hard?

29
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,400
If you can't handle this, you can go back
to being a model, you know.

30
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,920
I'll talk to Wut for you.

31
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,110
Oh, no, I don't want to.

32
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,480
In this life,

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,320
I'll never be a model again.

34
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,550
Why?

35
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,320
If I was good-looking as you, I wouldn't be sitting here.

36
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,710
It's nothing.

37
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,190
It's just an ordinary stuff, you know.

38
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,510
All the backstabbing.

39
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,440
No sincerity.

40
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,760
I think being with you like this is
the most comfortable thing.

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,400
You're a sweet one.

42
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,510
Let's go eat.

43
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,760
Are you hungry?

44
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,480
My wife made rice vermicelli with
Northern Thai curry sauce today.

45
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,070
Stewed chicken feet...c'mon, bro, let's go.

46
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,760
Are you hungry?

47
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,760
I'm home. I bought you soy milk.

48
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:30,670
Mom.

49
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,360
Mom.

50
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,440
Mom!

51
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,400
Mom!

52
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
What happened, Mom?

53
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,960
It's nothing, Son.

54
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,670
How could this be nothing, Mom?

55
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,590
If there's nothing, why is this place such a mess?

56
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:13,630
Easy, easy.

57
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,280
Could you please tell me what happened, Mom?

58
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,960
Umm...

59
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,190
Well...

60
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,760
When you were sick,

61
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,590
the medical bills were expensive.

62
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,880
And I didn't have enough savings.

63
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,480
So I had to get the money from the loan shark.

64
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,920
And, how much was it?

65
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,110
Well, a lot.

66
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,110
How much is a lot?

67
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,360
Three million Baht.

68
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,030
Joe,

69
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,590
I'm so sorry, Son.

70
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,000
I didn't know what to do.

71
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,190
All I knew was...

72
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,480
I couldn't lose you.

73
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Mom.

74
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,360
But it's alright. I'll hurry and find some work to do.

75
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,590
There's a maid job opening now.

76
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,110
Mom, Mom, Mom, you don't need to do anything.

77
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:29,710
Please.

78
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,030
Leave the rest to me, alright?

79
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,710
Joe, but you've just recovered.

80
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,630
And you just started a new job.

81
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,480
I don't want you to do too much of work.

82
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,110
It's alright.

83
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,800
I've got a way.

84
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,110
And it's my specialty.

85
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,880
Oh, this won't do.

86
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,710
C'mon, guys, be strong.

87
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,000
That's not the right move.

88
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,550
Shit, that's not it.

89
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,190
Hey,

90
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,480
the new stunt team...

91
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,110
isn't as good as the old one.

92
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,760
And what could we do?

93
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,190
My good boy Joe...

94
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,360
was fired by Tong, your boss,

95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,400
and he's out of the industry.

96
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,630
And what to do next?

97
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,920
We're gonna shoot next week.

98
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,840
No matter what, we gotta have the guy.

99
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,030
Hey, guys,

100
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,710
let's do it again.

101
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,800
Alright, we'll adjust. Let me see.

102
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,360
It must be possible.

103
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:00,280
Wut.

104
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,230
Hello,

105
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,800
are you busy?

106
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,510
What's up?

107
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,110
Well, I wanna try being a stunt.

108
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,000
Do you have any project that I can try?

109
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,000
I thought you told me you wanted a job off the scene?

110
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,270
Well, I got a little problem so I changed my mind.

111
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,070
This line of work, it's not just anyone that can do.

112
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,070
It's hard.

113
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,350
Wut, let him try first.

114
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,429
It couldn't be any worse.

115
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,030
Are you sure?

116
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,799
Yes, I am.

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,920
Okay, give it a try.

118
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,350
You got this.

119
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,150
Thank you very much.

120
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,760
Go easy on him.

121
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,640
Okay.

122
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,310
Then...

123
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,270
action.

124
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:05,390
Man, damn it, that's what I thought.

125
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,680
I told you it's dangerous.

126
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,800
Let's call it a day.

127
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,600
It's alright.

128
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,230
Let me try again,

129
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,470
please.

130
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,470
I'm sorry. Sorry.

131
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,270
One more shot, please.

132
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,800
I'll give you just more time, alright?

133
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,390
If you can't do it, you must quit.

134
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:19,960
Alright,

135
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,920
Alright, then if you're ready...

137
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,190
And...

138
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:26,640
action!

139
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,070
So, how was it?

140
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,390
What's your name?

141
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,070
My name is Joe.

142
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:08,960
Wut.

143
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,720
We got a new Joe.

144
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,840
I choose this one.

145
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,150
So, these are the contract and paperwork.

146
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,390
Sign them all.

147
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,150
And I'll try to find...

148
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,000
some stunt jobs for you.

149
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,720
Well, this job might not...

150
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,350
be able to...

151
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,520
pay all your debts in one go.

152
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,190
But...

153
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,000
it should keep the debt collectors away from your place.

154
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,000
Thank you.

155
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,230
You're welcome.

156
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,920
Joe, can I ask you something?

157
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,520
Yes.

158
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,350
Where did you learn all the stunt moves?

159
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,070
Oh,

160
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,190
I used to learn some boxing before.

161
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,840
Why?

162
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,470
Nothing,

163
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,840
it just...

164
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,110
feels familiar.

165
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,560
And one more thing,

166
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,640
do you have a copy of...

167
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,800
your bank account book?

168
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,000
Give it to me...

169
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,600
so that I can transfer the money to you.

170
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,640
You can transfer it to my old acccount
that you opened for me.

171
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,150
Old account?

172
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,230
Oh,

173
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,230
sorry, I forgot.

174
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,920
I...umm...

175
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,800
...happened to think of...

176
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,600
the account that my old agency opened for me
when I was their model.

177
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,720
Oh.

178
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,520
Yes.

179
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,470
Then, it's okay. I'll open a new account for you.

180
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,760
That's good. Okay.

181
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,270
I have a meeting, so don't forget to sign this, alright.

182
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,390
And leave it here

183
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,350
and close the door...

184
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,470
for me when you're done.

185
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,350
Okay,

186
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,350
thank you, Wut.

187
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:38,800
Yeah.

188
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,030
760,000 Baht!

189
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,800
I did a great job saving money in the past.

190
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,070
But how will I get the money out of the account?

191
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,960
And now I'm not the same old Joe.

192
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,800
Well, through ATM.

193
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,520
I just need to have the card.

194
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,470
I know that he's not just an ordinary fortune teller.

195
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,230
Otherwise, your Dad wouldn't come here often.

196
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,800
But I never thought that...

197
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,430
you would come back to see him too.

198
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,600
Thanks, Mike.

199
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,350
For making an appointment for me.

200
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,560
He canceled a meeting with the minister for you.

201
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,520
I hope your business is very important to you.

202
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,760
Whoa.

203
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,110
How can you stand a guy like him?

204
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,960
Actually, Mr. Ming is a decent man.

205
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,190
Hey, you didn't have to protect him.

206
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,720
You wanna work with me?

207
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,720
Are you for real?

208
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,390
Just kidding.

209
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,880
Ming wouldn't let that happen.

210
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,880
Would you need my assistance?

211
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,230
It's alright.

212
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:18,880
Even though I'm blind,

213
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,150
that doesn't mean I cannot see.

214
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,310
Does that smell good?

215
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:43,960
Yes.

216
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,960
You came a long way here,

217
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,190
not just to have tea with me, is that right?

218
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,920
You used to say...

219
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,270
Joe is not dead...

220
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,430
nor alive.

221
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,230
What did you mean?

222
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,070
What did you experience?

223
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,030
I happened to run into someone...

224
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,680
Nevermind.

225
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,070
I just would like to know what you meant.

226
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,270
These tea leaves...

227
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,310
are actually...

228
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,230
dead leaves.

229
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,920
But when you pour hot water into it.

230
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,000
You get aromatic tea to drink.

231
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,560
Then do you think...

232
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,520
these leaves are alive or not?

233
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,640
If he's not dead yet,

234
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,190
why hasn't he come back to me?

235
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,680
If you want good tea,

236
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,920
you must wait for the water to boil.

237
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,270
Some things can't be rushed.

238
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,390
But these past two years,
I've felt like it's killing me alive.

239
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,760
How long do I have to wait?

240
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,840
Not long.

241
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,070
Not long and the truth will come out.

242
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,000
The important thing is...

243
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,560
will you be able to see it?

244
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,230
Wow,

245
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,000
there are just two of us.

246
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,920
Why did you buy so much?

247
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,430
Oh, Mom

248
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,760
I just got a new job.

249
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,390
So I want to celebrate with you, Mom.

250
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,760
I bought so much. You have to eat a lot, you know, Mom.

251
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:07,640
Joe,

252
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,030
I wanna ask you this,

253
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,960
how did you become a stunt?

254
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,230
Have you ever practiced that kind of thing before?

255
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,430
I used to learn it from YouTube.

256
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:22,880
Oh.

257
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,069
And...wouldn't...

258
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,720
that be dangerous, Son?

259
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,390
I'd better risk myself rather than
letting you get hurt like last time.

260
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,560
Wow, how sweet of you, my baby.

261
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,960
And one more thing,

262
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,840
Mom, Wut takes a really good care of me.

263
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,800
He won't let anything happen to me.

264
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,720
And I got to see so many celebs, Mom.

265
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:43,520
Really?

266
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,310
Yes, tomorrow when I go to work,
I'll take photos of them for you.

267
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,270
You're the sweetest.

268
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,560
Let's eat.

269
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,230
Joe, do you want a prawn? Here, let me.

270
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,230
Oh, thank you.

271
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,840
Wow, so good.

272
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,070
Here, crispy pork, your favorite.

273
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:07,920
Do you want some fish?

274
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,150
Go ahead, Mom, I wanna eat this first.

275
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,390
Oh.

276
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,110
Just hit him, hard.

277
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,560
Alright.

278
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,920
And you'll lift the table again, right?

279
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,270
Right? And then spin?

280
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,680
Wow, now, they set everything in the studio?

281
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,430
Then we won't have to worry about the rain anymore?

282
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,000
Mr. Ming, are you shooting at this studio?

283
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,920
I'm shooting at the studio next door.

284
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,640
How do you know me?

285
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:06,150
Well, Mr. Ming, you're very famous.
How could I not know you?

286
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,520
Then would you excuse me, I need to...

287
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,230
Wait.

288
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,720
What's your name?

289
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,390
It's Joe.

290
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,520
Joe?

291
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,760
Excuse me, I need to have my make-up done.

292
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,150
Mr. Ming, do you know him?

293
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,520
No.

294
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,640
So, are you nervous?

295
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,030
A little bit.

296
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,840
Relax, relax. You can do this!

297
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,070
Thank you.

298
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,960
Let's go. Stand by.

299
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,800
Sit here. Tie him up.

300
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,640
Oh, Ming.

301
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,310
Hello.

302
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,520
Hello.

303
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,720
Is that guy a stunt?

304
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,470
Yes, he's Wut's new guy.

305
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,110
He's really good.

306
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,520
Ready? Silence, please.

307
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,390
Sound.

308
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,000
Speed.

309
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:44,800
Camera.

310
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,520
Ready?

311
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,110
And Action!

312
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,270
Cut!

313
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,270
Hey, why didn't you kick him?

314
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,030
Can you remember the moves?

315
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:05,310
You must kick him. Do you remember that?

316
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,520
Again, c'mon now, quickly.

317
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,030
Do it well, Joe,

318
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,430
ready?

319
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,110
And Action!

320
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,270
Cut!

321
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,270
Hey, what's going on? Focus!

322
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,640
I'm sorry.

323
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,800
What's wrong with you?

324
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,760
I'm sorry.

325
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,960
C'mon, man. You're wasting other people's time.

326
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,430
Again, alright? C'mon.

327
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,640
Sound.

328
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,470
Hey, focus.

329
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,390
C'mon.

330
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,110
Ready?

331
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,600
Action!

332
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,720
Cut! My God! That was awesome.

333
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,720
Thank you.

334
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,390
I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

335
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,920
So sorry.

336
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,840
Thank you.

337
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:35,920
So,

338
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,720
what's up? 100-take-star!

339
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,720
I'm sorry about today.

340
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,800
Hey, it's alright. Don't overthink.

341
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,070
It's your first time.

342
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,310
Joe whom I used to take care...

343
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,470
Man, his first time was a lot worse than yours.

344
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,000
He punched a lead male and broke his tooth.

345
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,430
Man, that fucker!

346
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,110
You're altogether.

347
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,070
I must apologize again for today. I...

348
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,070
Hey, don't think too much. You did well.

349
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,760
Just practice on the timing and you're good to go.

350
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,520
Alright, Wut, take care of him.

351
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,230
Alright, I must take a look at another scene now.

352
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,230
Goodbye.

353
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:07,920
Thank you.

354
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
C'mon, it's your first time. Everyone is like this too.

355
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,920
Do you mind spinning around for me?

356
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,110
Of course.

357
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,960
Shoulders.

358
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,070
Figure.

359
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,150
Head. Ears.

360
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,640
Exactly like him.

361
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,960
Like who?

362
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,880
You mean Tong?

363
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,390
Yes, right now Tong is about to shoot a new movie.

364
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,760
And we're looking for a stand-in.

365
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,720
I'd like you to become Tong's stand-in.

366
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,070
Thank you, Joy, for inviting.

367
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,230
But I think that a work that size...

368
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,560
won't suit a newbie like me.

369
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,070
I think other people will be more suitable.

370
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,070
Just think about it.

371
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,000
Here, this is my card.

372
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
This is a golden oppportunity for you.

373
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,310
Thank you.

374
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,680
It's good that you turned her down first.

375
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,800
Why is that?

376
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,030
It's a long story.

377
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:19,030
Have dinner at my place today.

378
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,150
I'll tell you all about it.

379
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,430
C'mon.

380
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,310
Thank you, everyone.

381
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,720
Thank you. Thank you.

382
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,000
Today we have sour soup and fried snakehead fish.

383
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,800
At first, we wanted the giant snakehead,
but it was sold out.

384
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,640
You always have beer.

385
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,110
Alright, let's go.

386
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,640
Get in the car.

387
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:52,230
Looks like this Joe has just signed a contract to be in Wut's stunt team.

388
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,520
His name is Joe.

389
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,470
And he's also in Wut's stunt team.

390
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,030
I think it may be a coincidence, Mr. Ming.

391
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,350
You saw it. He couldn't play.

392
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,470
But I heard that once I left, he was doing really well.

393
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,150
That's true.

394
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,920
Check his bio.

395
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,880
I want to know everything about him.

396
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,640
And things he doesn't want anyone to know.

397
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,150
Alright, Mr. Ming.

398
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,390
Wow, this looks so yummy.

399
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,350
Absolutely.

400
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,030
You're really like that Joe, just like Wut said.

401
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,720
Ja, talking about this makes me want to see that Joe.

402
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,840
Pumpkin is calling. Make yourself at home.

403
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,600
I'll check on my baby first.

404
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,880
It must be tiring.

405
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,150
I think having one child is not an easy job.

406
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,270
And you got twins, that must be really hard.

407
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,760
Joe.

408
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,720
Yes?

409
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
Who told you I got twins?

410
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,110
I heard people at the office talking.

411
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,920
My wife,

412
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,070
she was pregnant with twins.

413
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,190
But...

414
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,150
only one of them survived.

415
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,760
And...

416
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:48,070
I've never told anyone about this at the office.

417
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,840
How do you know?

418
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,350
Well...

419
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,720
I must have mistaken it
with the other one who's just had babies.

420
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,470
And I've checked with your Mom.

421
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,520
She said you never took boxing classes.

422
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:12,960
And Jojo said that you worked very smoothly.

423
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,190
Like a guy who had been in this industry for a long time.

424
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,560
C'mon, Joe,

425
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,640
is there anything that you're hiding?

426
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,760
What could I be hiding?

427
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,190
I just like watching action movies.
And I practiced by watching YouTube.

428
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,640
And sometimes, I helped other
people with the work off-scene.

429
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,640
That's it.

430
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,720
Are you sure?

431
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,150
Of course, Wut.

432
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,680
Trust me.

433
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,430
You've been so good to my Mom. Why would I lie to you?

434
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,030
Right?

435
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,680
Let's eat.

436
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,430
Alright.

437
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,390
My wife's sour soup with fried snakehead fish...

438
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,150
is the best in the world.

439
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,270
Try it.

440
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,520
If you like it, then go ahead.

441
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,640
How's it?

442
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:14,800
Fish?

443
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,030
Thank you, thank you.

444
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,390
Thank you so much.

445
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,110
That was the best meal that I had since I woke up.

446
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,110
If you like it, come here more often.

447
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,600
Thank you.

448
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,230
It's good that you're full.

449
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,430
Right, Wut.

450
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,270
Your junior named Joe...

451
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,230
Did he had an accident and disappeared?

452
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,390
Yeah.

453
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,000
It was an unlicensed production.

454
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,110
The tools didn't meet the standard.

455
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,920
Actually,

456
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,230
I had warned him before.

457
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,560
And that production didn't take any responsibilities?

458
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,520
What responsibilities?

459
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,960
They got gangsters backing them up.

460
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,230
They didn't have to ask for permission to shoot anywhere.

461
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,680
And when things happened...

462
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,800
I fought for Joe,

463
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,470
but I could do nothing.

464
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:15,920
Wow,

465
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,350
even you couldn't do anything?

466
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,640
They had everything covered up.

467
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,600
Even if we found the body...

468
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,520
we wouldn't be able to identify if it's the person we're looking for.

469
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,110
Speaking of it infuriates me.

470
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,880
Back then,

471
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,150
I should've stopped him.

472
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,800
C'mon, Wut.

473
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,430
Don't blame yourself.

474
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:04,190
Maybe it's his own fate.

475
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,350
That's why I don't want it to happen to you too.

476
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,000
What do you mean?

477
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,840
Ming's secretary called me.

478
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,230
He wanted you to shoot an ad.

479
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,920
But I already said no.

480
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,070
You shouldn't mess with him.

481
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:28,960
Ming...

482
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,600
was the one who made Joe die.

483
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,920
What happened, Mom?

484
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,230
It's nothing, Son.

485
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,840
And how much was it?

486
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,680
Three million Baht.

487
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,150
Well, Wut...about...

488
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,600
I know, I know.

489
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,680
It's your good opportunity.

490
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,270
But...how about this?

491
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,110
I got an idol who's in Korea in my team.

492
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,110
Wait for him to come back first.

493
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,310
And I'll let you work with him instead.

494
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:13,680
Wut...well, can I take this job?

495
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,960
The thing is my family needs a lot of money now.

496
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,230
I'll ask for this just for one time.

497
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,350
Please.

498
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,680
Just one time, okay?

499
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,110
Thank you.

500
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,270
Where are you going?

501
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,640
I'm going to be stunt.

502
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,600
That's why I need to keep fit.

503
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,030
But you just recovered.

504
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:56,270
I know that money is important.

505
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,520
But what if something bad happens to you again,

506
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,350
I think it's not worth it.

507
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,760
It's alright, Mom.

508
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,640
I'm still young.

509
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,680
You need to stay healthy.

510
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
So you can be with me for a long long time.

511
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,190
Alright.

512
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,600
Okay, then I'm gonna get going.

513
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,230
Here it is.

514
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,470
Thanks, Auntie.

515
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,760
Wow,

516
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:10,680
the ad setting is so much different from movies and series.

517
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,720
That's normal. The ad industry is like this

518
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,000
and this is a big brand.

519
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:14,520
Hello.

520
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,560
Hello.

521
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:16,350
Hello.

522
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,350
Learn from this. Easy.

523
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,230
Alright.

524
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,560
Right, Wut.

525
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,070
Yes?

526
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,680
I think you don't have to be with me today.

527
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,470
I'll be alright on my own. You don't need to stay.

528
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,840
It's alright, it's my job.

529
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,840
And...

530
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,640
I'd like to see someone too.

531
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,720
Thank you, Wut,

532
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,030
for changing your mind and letting Joe work with us.

533
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,880
Anyway,

534
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,110
please take a good care of this Joe.

535
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,110
Don't let anything happen to him like...

536
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,560
the old Joe.

537
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,640
If you're gonna be this protective,

538
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,030
I'll take a really good care of him.

539
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,030
I'm gonna get going now.

540
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,030
See you, goodbye.

541
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,030
Take care of yourself.

542
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,520
Oh, Ming.

543
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,800
This way, I've prepared you a motored home.

544
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,719
By the way. what did you do?

545
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,880
Your skin looks brighter.

546
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,600
You've slipped.

547
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,920
A guy like him doesn't like to be pleased.

548
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,920
He likes someone stubborn.

549
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,270
Why don't join me in the motored home?

550
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,960
That's okay.

551
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:31,310
I like being with lots of people.

552
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,520
Thank you.

553
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:35,760
Man,

554
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,150
what's wrong with him? What's his agency?

555
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:38,190
Would you like me to talk to his agency?

556
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:39,389
It's alright.

557
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,520
Let's go.

558
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,639
Alright, next, the theme is the dark romance fashion set.

559
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,719
Everyone, please do it as briefed.

560
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:50,639
Yes.

561
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,310
Alright, c'mon.

562
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,719
Okay. One. Two. Three.

563
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,000
Okay.

564
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,430
One. Two. Three.

565
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,470
Okay, good.

566
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,560
Good.

567
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,390
Okay, strike a pose.

568
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,310
Alright, you...

569
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,000
Yes?

570
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,230
Smile less.

571
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,030
I'm sorry, I'm used to action movies.

572
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,920
Alright, okay, just try your best.

573
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:27,760
Smile...okay.

574
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,840
Alright, try.

575
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,760
Ah. One. Two. Three.

576
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,560
Alright, Mr. Ming, please.

577
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,840
Ah, okay. Change the setting.

578
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,880
Aside from the soul,

579
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,560
I guess there're some feelings...

580
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,520
that have passed to this body as well.

581
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,470
Okay, step closer.

582
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,470
A little bit more. Right there.

583
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,230
One. Two.

584
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,310
Okay.

585
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,270
Will he ever smile?

586
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,000
Hey, don't you know?

587
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,110
Normally, he only smiles when he plays a movie with Tong.

588
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,640
His brother-in-law.

589
00:36:59,070 --> 00:36:59,640
Oh.

590
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,560
But he looks really uptight.

591
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:14,560
If he smiles, he will be more handsome, don't you think?

592
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,840
Okay, Wan, we'll do a group shot.

593
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,350
Ah, okay.

594
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,600
Can I switch pairs, please?

595
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,470
I want that one.

596
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,430
Er...well, we could give it a try.

597
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,190
Alright, you come and stand next to Ming.

598
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,350
Alright, you come and stand next to Ming.

599
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,680
One. Two.

600
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:11,310
What's wrong? You're not as good as earlier.

601
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
Okay.

602
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,960
That's nice.

603
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,960
Thank you.

604
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,430
Calm down.

605
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,720
No one will know.

606
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,680
Is everything done?

607
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,000
All is well.

608
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:02,640
Thank you so much, Mr.....

609
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,680
It's Jim.

610
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,070
You can call me Secretary Jim.

611
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,000
Thank you, Secretary Jim.

612
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,920
If I did something wrong today, I would like to apologize.

613
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,470
You did well.

614
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:17,390
Or else Mr. Ming wouldn't ask you
to have dinner with him.

615
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,720
Me?

616
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,840
Just me?

617
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,150
Ming, are you drunk?

618
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,390
I thought you'd forgotten about me.

619
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,760
How about you? Did you forget about me?

620
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:54,640
Mr. Joe.

621
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,270
Sit down. Dinner is ready.

622
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,110
Thank you.

623
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,270
Thank you for inviting me.

624
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,920
Let me do something for you, Mr. Ming.

625
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,150
I'll pour this for you.

626
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,070
No!

627
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,520
Tomorrow, Mr. Ming has to work in the morning..

628
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,270
Oh, is that so?

629
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,840
That means...

630
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,030
Mr. Ming has work to do every day, right?

631
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,680
Then, that's good.

632
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,960
I'll pour it for you. Let's relax a bit.

633
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,680
And for Secretary Jim.

634
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,430
No.

635
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,470
I need to work.

636
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,150
C'mon.

637
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,600
Thank you, Mr. Joe.

638
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,800
Mr. Ming, too. Let's call it a night. We're all drunk.

639
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,640
Where are you from?

640
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Bangkok.

641
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,840
How did you know Wut?

642
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,720
I work for him.

643
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,190
And he happens to need a stunt.

644
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,070
But you're the only one...

645
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,430
that Wut came and took care at the set personally.

646
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,110
Why?

647
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,110
I don't know.

648
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,270
Maybe it's because I'm like his old junior.

649
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:26,390
You know him?

650
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,600
Wut told me a bit about him.

651
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,110
What did he tell you?

652
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,960
He said we had the same name.

653
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:35,880
And...

654
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,760
when he shot a movie, he had an accident and passed.

655
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,800
He's still alive.

656
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,680
Oh.

657
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,960
That's what Wut told me.

658
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,190
I don't know the detail.

659
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,840
Get out of here.

660
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,760
And tell your boss that...

661
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,350
Joe's still alive.

662
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,190
Yes.

663
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,560
And watch your mouth...

664
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,350
when you talk about Joe.

665
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,430
Other people like you because of that name,

666
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,880
remember that.

667
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,070
Yes,

668
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:33,840
I know that already.

669
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:58,390
This is for Secretary Jim.

670
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,960
No, I gotta work.

671
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,920
Thank you, Mr. Joe.

672
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:08,230
The day after tomorrow, off to Singapore.

673
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,150
The way is clear.

674
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,030
Excuse me.

675
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,030
I found this in the restroom.

676
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:26,640
I think it might belong to a customer here.

677
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,230
Oh, of course, I'll return this to its owner.

678
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:31,430
Thank you.

679
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,070
Jo.

680
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,000
Thank you for letting me go to work as a model that day.

681
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:47,840
Right,

682
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:50,520
Wut told me about your issue.

683
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,720
Next month, you prepare yourself
and be with the stunt team.

684
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,310
You don't have to work with me anymore.

685
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,190
Thank you for understanding.

686
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,720
I'll come back and eat with you often.

687
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:01,880
Right,

688
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,110
do you have something to do this afternoon?

689
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,310
Ko won a lotto,

690
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,600
so he said he would treat us a meal with karaoke.

691
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:10,150
I'm sorry.

692
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,760
I have something do to already.

693
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:13,760
Oh,

694
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,230
you got a girl?

695
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,800
A girlfriend?

696
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:17,880
No,

697
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:20,560
I'm going to break into someone's house.

698
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:34,110
You're such an ass.

699
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,110
Good luck.

700
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,920
Thank you so much, Jo.

701
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,110
I'm gonna get going now.

702
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:41,720
I don't want anyone waiting.

703
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,030
Goodbye.

704
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,520
Good luck!

705
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:44,110
Tong.

706
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:48,000
Why didn't you choose me?

707
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,680
Who is that?

708
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,230
How dare you break into this house?

709
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,640
Do you know whose house this is?

710
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,760
Hands above your head.

711
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:24,880
And slowly turn around.
