1
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,000
Ming, hold on, hold on.

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,479
Stand still.

3
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,150
Be still, let me take a look.

4
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:37,590
Are you done?

5
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah.

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,670
Everything was like a dream.

7
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,320
Being together...

8
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,710
How is it?

9
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,880
Isn't it pretty?

10
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,070
You see me as a dog?

11
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,590
Going out together... / This is very cute!

12
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,960
Do you see me as a dog?

13
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,320
Being happy together...

14
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,800
But how long...

15
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,190
would this reality last?

16
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,000
If this was a dream... / Let's take a photo.

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,840
What photo?

18
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,800
Well, of us.

19
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,480
It would be the sweetest dream. / With what?

20
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,280
With the christmas tree.

21
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,670
No, that's enough.

22
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,760
It was the dream...

23
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,550
from which I didn't want to wake up.

24
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,510
Wow, Ming, there are so many pretty things here.

25
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,590
Actually, this is nice too, do you like it?

26
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,590
You don't?

27
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,590
Ming.

28
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,630
Ming.

29
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,230
Take a look at this.

30
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,880
This couple mugs are so cute.

31
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,960
Why are you buying so many things?

32
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,630
There are lots at home, aren't there?

33
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,840
Oh, well, the ones at home are old.

34
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,960
And you've moved in now.

35
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,800
How can I let you use the old ones?

36
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,670
And look at these two, they are so cute!

37
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,030
I've been wanting to use the couple mugs for a long time.

38
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,630
But back then, I didn't have anyone.

39
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,320
And who told you that I was someone to you?

40
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,400
Oh...I thought...

41
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,190
Let me tell you this, if we keep living together...

42
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,190
you wouldn't want me to be your boyfriend.

43
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,030
I'll just go find something else to buy.

44
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:59,070
Hello. We can also engrave the name on the mug for you.

45
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,840
Ming, come here.

46
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,230
Come help me.

47
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,630
Ming.

48
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,630
Alright.

49
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,320
Ta-da!

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Do you like these?

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,070
Why did you buy those?

52
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,070
Oh, so we can use them as a pair.

53
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,670
No, you use them yourself.

54
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,960
Oh, Ming, I'm kidding

55
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,670
Here, this is the real ones.

56
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,000
The green one is mine. And the gold one is yours.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,070
You make me feel like my life is getting better.

58
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,440
Are you a leaf or something?

59
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
C'mon.

60
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,920
You bought a lot. There are still a lot here at home.

61
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,630
Well, can't I change it?

62
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,840
Here, the last one...

63
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,840
These are rare items. Ta-da!

64
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,880
These are the only pair of pillow cases in this world.

65
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,190
Because it's got your name on it.

66
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,480
And mine also.

67
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,960
How are these?

68
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,360
Use them alone!

69
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,960
Oh, Ming...

70
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,590
I've changed the case for you.

71
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,590
Oh, right, when we left, I got a brochure.

72
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,320
I think this place is kinda old.

73
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,400
And it's too small for the both of us.

74
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,550
This is the brochure of Akkrayotha Group.

75
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,550
I see many celebs live there.

76
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,150
But I don't know if I'll be able to get a loan or not.

77
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,150
Ming, take a look and see if you like it.

78
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,230
Hey, Ming.

79
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:12,230
No need to. Just one big bed is enough for me.

80
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,550
Here, let me help you.

81
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,760
It's alright, I got this.

82
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,920
Oh, Ming!

83
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,670
Let me change it first.

84
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:25,440
If I had noticed it then...

85
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,320
everything wouldn't have had to end up like this.

86
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,480
Yim, someone introduced me to Crypto.

87
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,920
Do you think it works?

88
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
You can't even get on TikTok...

89
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,480
You'll be scamed for sure.

90
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,630
What the hell?

91
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,710
But I wanna earn extra money.

92
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,400
Each day I grow older. I don't know how long I can do this.

93
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,150
Right, right, Joe.

94
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,150
The other day, I heard that...

95
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,070
There's an international production coming to shoot a movie here in Thailand.

96
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,880
And they want a Thai stuntman in it.

97
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,400
Really good money.

98
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Really? / Yeah, I'll send you the pics.

99
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Where?

100
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,880
Stop it right there!

101
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,880
Do you know that kind of production is unlicensed?

102
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,360
They do it for money laundering.

103
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,960
If one dies, no one will be responsible.

104
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,590
Don't give stupid advice like that.

105
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,550
If you're that free, help me clear this box.

106
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,030
Trust me, it's not worth it.

107
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,030
Yes.

108
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,070
Joe, are you done?

109
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,230
Pao asked for you.

110
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:33,920
Alright.

111
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
Alright, follow me. / I'll be there.

112
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
You're done? / Yeah.

113
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,920
Thank you.

114
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Pao, Joe is here.

115
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,760
Yes, Pao.

116
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,000
Tong has to attend an event,

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,710
so I'm thinking about changing the script in the dance scene.

118
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,670
The character will wear a mask,

119
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,360
and let you play as him instead, Joe.

120
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,280
Pao.

121
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,510
That's the important scene that the fans are waiting to see.

122
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,400
And so?

123
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,110
The last time, was the drowning scene important?

124
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,190
Tong had Joe play instead.

125
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,280
Pao, I think you should calm down first.

126
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,960
Well, I only know how to play risky scenes.

127
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,030
Dancing scene or that kind of stuff...

128
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:14,960
I don't know how to play that.

129
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,030
Joe, what's your role?

130
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,190
A stand-in, right?

131
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,680
A stand-in should be able to play anything.

132
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,030
Right, Tong?

133
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,230
If you think that Joe can play,

134
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,799
I'm alright with that.

135
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,720
You got this, man.

136
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,429
But...

137
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,190
Oh, Tong.

138
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,429
Listen to me first, listen.

139
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:45,190
Tong. Tong.

140
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,760
Pao, man...

141
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,150
I gotta work with Tong in so many films.

142
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,920
Go change.

143
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,920
And, I'll leave it to you.

144
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,920
Dew, how is it going?

145
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,920
Alright.

146
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,560
It's done. My stand-in career.

147
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,310
Why? You got to play an important scene.

148
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,150
Well, it's good.

149
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,030
But my work is to support the main character.

150
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,000
Not stealing his work like this.

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And you know...

152
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,110
if I can't play it well, I'll be scolded.

153
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,230
And if I play it well, I'll be despised.

154
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,470
So it's a lose-lose job this time.

155
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,150
Well, you said you wanted to build a career.

156
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,110
If there's a chance coming, you gotta take it first.

157
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,150
If it turns out well,

158
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,310
you might not have to be anyone else's stand-in ever again.

159
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,920
I'm back.

160
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,520
What's wrong? Wrong move in a scene?

161
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,150
A bit.

162
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,310
I had to play the scene I wasn't used to.

163
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,030
It's much harder than the risky ones.

164
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,640
What kind of scene?

165
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,470
Well, how shall I put it? It's...

166
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,470
Joe, Joe!

167
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,430
Wut!

168
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,430
Right, my wife's family sent us lots of river tiger prawns.

169
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,640
And we couldn't finish all of them, so I'm giving some to you.

170
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,310
Thank you. / But today...you...

171
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,760
got a guest?

172
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,190
Er...

173
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,760
This is Ming. He is...er...

174
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm Joe's friend.

175
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,150
Please.

176
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
Is he your boyfriend?

177
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,350
Give me some more time first.

178
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,560
Wow.

179
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,920
Which family is he from?

180
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,190
He looks really well-dressed.

181
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,640
Mmm, I really don't know about that.

182
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,600
I never asked him.

183
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,560
Wait, you're about to be together,

184
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,720
but you don't know where he's from?

185
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,600
Are you nuts?

186
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,920
Nevermind.

187
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,150
So, why are you here today?

188
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,760
To talk about work?

189
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,760
Right, come here.

190
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,640
It's hard to say.

191
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,190
But from what happened today, people talked.

192
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,190
Tong was stolen a scene by his own stand-in.

193
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,600
Well, I tried to reject that.

194
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,070
But I didn't know how to stop Pao.

195
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,230
It's alright. I understand.

196
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,230
And I've cleared your name for you.

197
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,350
Simply put,

198
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,110
we're gonna reshoot the scene we did today.

199
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,880
Because we had to save Tong's reputation.

200
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,960
But with this,

201
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,430
the scene that you played today won't be used.

202
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,960
Hey, that's alright with me, really.

203
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,600
That's really good, and it's more comfortable with me.

204
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,230
Actually, I want to play this kind of scene too.

205
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,230
But it must not happen like this.

206
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,230
That's the spirit!

207
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,270
You got a good mindset.

208
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,520
But I won't let your work wasted for free.

209
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,150
Your acting video today...

210
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,150
I've sent it to all producers in the industry.

211
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,760
They're so excited.

212
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,310
No one has ever thought that you will have this gift in acting.

213
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,760
Therefore, some day...

214
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,390
someone will ask you to play a main character for sure.

215
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,680
Trust me.

216
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
Thank you, Wut.

217
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,230
Love you, man.

218
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,470
Haven't had fresh tiger prawns like this in a long time, right?

219
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,350
Why didn't you tell me?

220
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,470
That you got to play the important scene instead of Tong?

221
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,760
I see that you're close to him.

222
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,920
So I didn't want to tell you.

223
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
I was afraid that you would be mad at me.

224
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,760
Why would I be mad at you?

225
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,760
Well, that's true.

226
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,680
Let's eat the prawns. I'll do it for you.

227
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,270
Hey, it's alright.

228
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,600
You've been tired all day.

229
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
I'll do it for you.

230
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,470
Thanks.

231
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,150
Right, Wut asked me...

232
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:50,150
if you interested in being an actor in his agency?

233
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,150
No.

234
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,520
I like the quietness.

235
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,270
And one more thing,

236
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,070
I don't like to act as someone else.

237
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,270
That's what I thought.

238
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:06,520
Right, there will be a wrap party this coming Saturday...

239
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,520
Wut asked me to ask you to join.

240
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,560
Do you want me to go?

241
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,390
Of course, I do.

242
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,350
But if you don't wanna go, then it's alright.

243
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,560
I can go by myself.

244
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
I'll go with you.

245
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,150
Really?

246
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,640
Are you sure?

247
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Mmm.

248
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,920
I'm so happy.

249
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,000
I want more of these.

250
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,310
Just for today.

251
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,520
So no more on the other days?

252
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,000
On the other days, you will be the one doing this for me.

253
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,840
Alright, then I'll eat more and more prawns today.

254
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,030
All of these.

255
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,270
Cheers!

256
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,230
It's a wrap, finally.

257
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:11,030
I think if it took longer, we would see the director fighting with the actor.

258
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,960
That's for sure. Absolutely.

259
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,960
C'mon.

260
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,230
Right, Joe.

261
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,110
Huh? / I'll go to the restroom.

262
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,150
Alright, I'll be sitting at this table.

263
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,800
Jo, hello. Hello. Hi there.

264
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Sit here! Sit here! / Yes.

265
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:35,000
You brought a friend to sign with Wut?

266
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,880
Signing in, yeah, but not with Wut's agency...

267
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,520
What does that mean?

268
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,640
Don't listen to him. I just brought him here to see the world.

269
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,110
Right, anyway...

270
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:51,640
After that day, have you seen Tong?

271
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,640
What did he say?

272
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,680
Well...

273
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,880
Hello there, rising star.

274
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,640
Hey, I'm gonna go get more beer.

275
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,680
Anyone care to join?

276
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,680
Yes, I'm going with you. Let's go.

277
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,840
Yeah, let's go.

278
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,920
Get up, Yim. Help me carry the beer.

279
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,070
So, I've seen the scene you played.

280
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,720
It was great.

281
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,230
If you're this good...

282
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:31,230
I guess I'll have to prepare another new stand-in for me.

283
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:34,350
Whoa, Tong, that's too much.

284
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,560
I'm not that good yet.

285
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,560
I just tried to act like you.

286
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,270
But still, it's a long way compared to you.

287
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,960
It's good that you can think that way.

288
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,840
So you won't feel sad about having your scene cut out.

289
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,840
You really put the effort in acting the scene.

290
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,960
Oh, Tong.

291
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,800
Oh, Ming, you're here to see me?

292
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,520
Then, excuse me...

293
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,390
I saw your friend talking to Tong.

294
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,070
Yeah, they are close.

295
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,070
Right.

296
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,920
So what people said about your friend's sister and Tong being together,

297
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,920
it's true, isn't it?

298
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,760
Oh, and this is my wrap-up party, so what are you doing here, Sol?

299
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,840
I came here to see you.

300
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,000
It's almost Christmas now.

301
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,600
I want to ask you to go with me.

302
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,030
In case you're still free.

303
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,560
I'm sorry, Sol. I'm not available.

304
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,150
Ming and I are together now.

305
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,030
Oh.

306
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,000
So you brought him to let everyone know?

307
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,760
I tried to tell you so many times.

308
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,800
But I didn't have a chance.

309
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,760
So I'm too late again...

310
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,470
But anyway, congratulations.

311
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,720
Hey, Ming, wait, Ming!

312
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,030
Ming!

313
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,920
Ming, calm down.

314
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,430
Ming!

315
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,230
Calm down, we just bumped into each other.

316
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,230
Didn't I tell you...

317
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,960
not to mess with him?

318
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,190
But we're in the same agency.

319
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,190
So?

320
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,230
Hey, Ming! Ming...

321
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,430
Sol will...

322
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,430
Someone will see us.

323
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,680
Let them see.

324
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,680
So they'll know that you're mine.

325
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,760
Ming.

326
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,720
Ming!

327
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,230
Follow me.

328
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,680
I'll go home myself.

329
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
Give it a blast today!

330
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,640
Here comes our new superstar!

331
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,470
How are you doing?

332
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:11,520
Applause!

333
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,640
What's wrong with you all?

334
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,350
Whoa!

335
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,310
Well, Pao wants you as a supporting character in his new movie.

336
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,070
It's a pretty outstanding role.

337
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,560
You'll play Sol's right-hand man.

338
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,960
Sol is the main lead?

339
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,030
No, you're the second pair. The main lead is Tong.

340
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,520
Oh, won't he and Pao fight again though?

341
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,720
You know, nowadays, he chooses his lead from...

342
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,680
the celeb's followers.

343
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,640
Man, I don't wanna be in the middle of this mess.

344
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,030
Especially...now.

345
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,350
Hey. Now, Joe,

346
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,680
you're an actor.

347
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,230
You don't have to manage trivial things.

348
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:57,110
Let me do all the work because I'm a producer.

349
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,190
What you gotta do now is be at ease and party.

350
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,190
Cheers, guys!

351
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,430
Give me more drinks.

352
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,560
Oh, you're back?

353
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,560
Mmm.

354
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,920
I've made you some tea. Have it.

355
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
So you've talked to Tong?

356
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,680
We've cleared things up. Nothing to worry about.

357
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,390
I'll go take a shower now.

358
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,270
Oh, Joe.

359
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,030
Huh? / This is the crew's resting area.

360
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,190
Celebs sit and eat in the room with A/C.

361
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,800
Hey, Yim.

362
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,150
Even if I were to be a superstar,

363
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:00,920
no matter what, I'd still be sitting here. Got a problem with that, huh?

364
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,390
Joe, are you referring to someone?

365
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,190
A superstar? An action superstar?

366
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,600
Tong, hello.

367
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,270
Hello.

368
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,600
Tong, are you here to see Wut?

369
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,600
Oh, yes, I bought him something.

370
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,030
And...what are you guys eating?

371
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,430
Looks tasty.

372
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,430
May I join you?

373
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,560
Hey, Yim, get more food here!

374
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,920
I don't think it's a good idea, Tong.

375
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,190
It's hot here.

376
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:44,230
I'll take you to the room with an A/C

377
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,920
I heard that you're gonna be a full-time actor now.

378
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,230
Congrats.

379
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,070
Thank you.

380
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,230
I learned it all from you, Tong.

381
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,640
And with that, will you still be able to be my stand-in?

382
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,350
There are lots of action scenes.

383
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,600
I'll recommend you great stuntmen.

384
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,030
I know lots of them.

385
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,030
But I want you, Joe.

386
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:17,070
This movie will be aired across Asia.

387
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:20,960
And if the stand-in is not good,

388
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,760
it will also ruin my reputation.

389
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,070
Tong, the thing is...I'm not sure...

390
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,920
if I can do both jobs at the same time.

391
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,070
Enough.

392
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,230
I know that you've been avoiding me.

393
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,470
About Ming.

394
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,680
Tong.

395
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,270
I actually don't want to get involved with anyone else's business

396
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,350
if it's not related to my personal life.

397
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,800
Why wouldn't I know...

398
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,600
what you hoped for?

399
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,560
What do you mean, Tong?

400
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:56,000
Don't tell me that you don't know that...

401
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,190
Ming is from Akkrayotha Group's family.

402
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,230
I actually know that...

403
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,230
you're kinda tired of being a stand-in.

404
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,430
But I didn't know that...

405
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,920
you would make a shortcut.

406
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,030
When we left, I got a brochure.

407
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,760
It's a brochure of Akkrayotha Group.

408
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,560
I see many celebs live there.

409
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,150
I'm warning you because I mean you good.

410
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,520
Stop what you're doing now.

411
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,520
Before his family knows.

412
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,520
Behave.

413
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:37,640
And I'll let you be my stand-in...

414
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
forever.

415
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
Joe.

416
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,430
Joe.

417
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Joe.

418
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,640
Huh?

419
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,680
Is the movie not good?

420
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,680
Oh, I'm just a bit tired.

421
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,070
I heard Tong said that...

422
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,680
you'd become a main lead now.

423
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:26,230
It's just a small supporting role.

424
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,600
Ming.

425
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,920
Huh?

426
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,470
Why did you choose me?

427
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,270
What are you asking?

428
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:48,470
It was you who invited me in your car, wasn't it?

429
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,840
And are you happy?

430
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,270
What's wrong with you?

431
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,600
I just want to know if you're happy.

432
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,560
Of course.

433
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,920
Aren't you?

434
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,150
I am

435
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:13,070
But I'm just afraid that...

436
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:16,070
I'm the only one being happy here.

437
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,230
I think you've worked too hard.

438
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,960
How about this?

439
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,840
Let's go out on Christmas day.

440
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,840
My treat. And you can't say no.

441
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Really?

442
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Are you for real?

443
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,070
Hello, Mr. Ming, welcome.

444
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
This way, please.

445
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,150
Let's go.

446
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,960
This place is beautiful.

447
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,310
Wut told me...

448
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,310
lots of celebs come here to eat.

449
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,310
Oh, yeah?

450
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
But you'll become a celeb soon too.

451
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,800
A celeb? A clown, maybe?

452
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,800
And do you come here often?

453
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,150
Sometimes. Why?

454
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,390
Nothing.

455
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,840
Ming.

456
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,230
Since this year, you've been so good,

457
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,560
so Santa has something for you.

458
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,600
Here.

459
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,270
When did you buy it?

460
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:20,270
Not telling. Open it and see if you like it.

461
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,960
Actually, I'm not good at picking out this kind of stuff.

462
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,760
But I just found out that...

463
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,760
the top one is expensive alright.

464
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:33,880
The top one?

465
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,800
Mmm!

466
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,800
Who told you that?

467
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,350
I bought it online.

468
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,880
They said that this one is the top and newly released.

469
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,800
This is just a standard.

470
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,600
Here, this is the top one.

471
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,230
Really?

472
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,270
I thought I picked the decent shop.

473
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,840
Alright then, I'll just...

474
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,520
buy you a new one.

475
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,720
That's okay.

476
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,560
Even it's not the top one, but I like it.

477
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,640
Really?

478
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,600
And...won't it be too normal?

479
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,560
Can I not like something normal?

480
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Wear it for me.

481
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,640
Do you like it?

482
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,880
Actually, I got something for you as well.

483
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
Really?

484
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Oh, Ming.

485
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,310
Sis.

486
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,600
What a small world!

487
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,880
Let's go eat together.

488
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,390
I have a reservation at the VIP table.

489
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,150
It's alright.

490
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,800
I don't want to disturb both of you.

491
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,600
No need to say no.

492
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
It's Christmas, you know.

493
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
We must have a meal together, right?

494
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
Is that true?

495
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,390
Yeah, Ming, tell your friend to join us.

496
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,390
Thank you.

497
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,600
So Joe, you're friends with Ming?

498
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,190
Er, yeah.

499
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,760
Mmm.

500
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:00,030
And...how did you two know each other?

501
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,110
Er...

502
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,960
Well, Joe is Tong's stand-in.

503
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,720
I happened to meet him at the set.

504
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,470
Oh, you're a stand-in.

505
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,000
So you gotta play risky scenes for Tong a lot.

506
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,560
You're just great!

507
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,110
I've seen every movie.

508
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Thank you.

509
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,190
But I've just known...

510
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,430
that you two are this close.

511
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,430
So why are you eating together on Christmas Day

512
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,150
Er...

513
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,350
So? Or...

514
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,110
there are friends coming later?

515
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,800
Well...

516
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,520
I was the one who invited Joe here.

517
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,720
He must have met Ming here.

518
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,070
So they've sat together.

519
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,070
Right?

520
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,070
Yes.

521
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,880
I was eating here alone...

522
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,760
And I happened to run into Joe.

523
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,920
Then we won't be disturbing you anymore.

524
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Let's go, Joe.

525
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,350
Excuse us.

526
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,520
Sol.

527
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:45,760
It's fortunate that I happened to have a meeting here.

528
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,600
Can you see that you two don't match?

529
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,030
But Ming can take me for who I am, Sol.

530
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,150
How about his family?

531
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,110
Do you know what his family does?

532
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,470
Yes, I do.

533
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,470
You know, yet you still want to continue?

534
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,960
I'm saying this because I'm worried about you.

535
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,230
You've seen his sister.

536
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,640
These people only date celebrities.

537
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,639
Sol.

538
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,920
I thank you.

539
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,230
But this is between me and Ming.

540
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,230
Where are you going?

541
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:26,190
I'm going home to wait for Ming.

542
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,600
If I were you...

543
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,030
I wouldn't make you feel uncomfortable like this.

544
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,720
Seriously,

545
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,390
I think you can be an actor.

546
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,960
Are you interested?

547
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,230
No.

548
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,230
No?

549
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,190
Well, talking about this industry,

550
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:15,520
I've been wanting to run away and do something else too.

551
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,270
I'm so bored of this industry.

552
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:19,470
I always see you complain like this all the time.

553
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,560
But your schedule is full till next year.

554
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,310
Well, it's tiring.

555
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Someone's calling.

556
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,520
Excuse me.

557
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:46,430
So, is Joe the one who taught you...

558
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,070
to eat instant noodles?

559
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,800
Why do you think so?

560
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,960
Hey, I'm your sis. How could I not tell...

561
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,030
that my bro was seeing someone.

562
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:04,680
Alright, say whatever you want, I'm all ears.

563
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,110
I'm not Dad and Mom.

564
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:11,390
And one more thing, whoever makes my bro happy,

565
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,920
I'm always alright with that.

566
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,760
Do I seem like I'm happy?

567
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,760
Yes.

568
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,000
You gotta see yourself when you're alone with Joe.

569
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,760
I haven't seen you smile like that ages ago.

570
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,800
Ming, you should go and celebrate with him.

571
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,270
I'll come up with something to tell Tong.

572
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Thanks a lot.

573
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,030
Merry Christmas.

574
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,190
Merry Christmas.

575
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,920
Hurry.

576
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,070
Bye.

577
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,430
Hey, Ming.

578
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,030
Where are you going?

579
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,070
I'm gonna get going.

580
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:08,110
On a special day like this, I'd like you two to spend time together.

581
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,640
Don't go yet. Stay.

582
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,920
I have a surprise for May.

583
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,150
Here.

584
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,030
What do you think?

585
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:27,230
Do you think she'll say yes?

586
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,000
Tong, you don't have to worry about that.

587
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,270
She loves you so much.

588
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,030
She will be so happy.

589
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,560
And how about you, Ming?

590
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,560
Are you happy to have me as your bro?

591
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,350
Of course.

592
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:33,390
Well, you two are the perfect match.

593
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,520
Congratulations.

594
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,470
Oh, Ming, you're leaving?

595
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,600
Do you want me to go now?

596
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,760
Okay.

597
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,350
Tong.

598
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,000
This is May and Ming.

599
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,960
They're Mr. Jaran's children, our sponsor.

600
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,800
Oh, hello.

601
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
Hello.

602
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,230
I love your fencing scene so much.

603
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:19,150
Oh, that one? That was my first movie.

604
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,150
You like it? Thank you very much.

605
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,110
Then, can we take a photo with you? / Of course.

606
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,430
Come here, get closer.

607
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:39,230
Okay, here we go. One. Two. Three.

608
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,720
Thank you.

609
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:43,960
Is it okay?

610
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,960
Excuse me.

611
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,800
I need to go now.

612
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,800
So you're May, right?

613
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,800
Yes.

614
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,800
So you must be a uni student, right?

615
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,350
Yes, a third-year.

616
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,430
Third-year. Oh, then you're gonna be doing a thesis soon, right?

617
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
America.

618
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,110
It's good enough for you to study here.

619
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:26,720
Why would you go there? And who's gonna take care of you, Ming?

620
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,560
I just don't want to stay here anymore.

621
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,960
I want to be alone.

622
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,640
Alone?

623
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,190
How will you survive? Tell me.

624
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,310
I can do that. / Where are you gonna study? What state?

625
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,470
I can do it, really.

626
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,070
Ming, talk to me first. Ming!

627
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,190
Will you marry me, May?

628
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,430
Yes!

629
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,150
Ming.

630
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,800
Hey, Ming! Ming! Ming! Ming! Ming!

631
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,640
I'm home.

632
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,960
Oh, Ming.

633
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,680
How can you be so drunk?

634
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,680
Why didn't you call me to pick you up?

635
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,520
Oh, Ming.

636
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,880
Thank you, Ming.

637
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:52,680
This is the best Christmas in my life.

638
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,760
Ming.

639
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:17,350
When did you come back?

640
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:19,720
Tonight, you gotta buy me dinner to make things up.

641
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,030
I gotta shoot this movie all day.

642
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:21,920
Maybe next time.

643
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:25,000
After I finish shooting, I'll treat you a meal.

644
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,230
That was May. She's having a headache...

645
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:29,230
Go take care of May.

646
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:32,070
If I hadn't been so stubborn and got into the water alone like that,

647
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,430
you wouldn't have had to be so troubled.

648
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:35,960
In exchange of a pneumonia,

649
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,960
it's worth it.

650
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,110
Will you marry me, May?

651
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,520
Yes!

652
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:56,310
Tong.

653
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Why didn't you choose me?

654
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,520
Why did you choose me?

655
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,600
What are you asking?

656
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,960
Wasn't it you who invited me...

657
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,560
into your car?

658
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,350
If your face is not seen, you look just like Tong.

659
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:19,720
Especially, looking at the back.

660
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,430
Who could look so much alike?

661
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:22,430
Tong.

662
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:25,960
Ming, you like doing it from behind?

663
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,840
I see you only do this position.

664
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:30,960
Dancing scene or that kind of stuff...I don't know how to play that.

665
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,150
Joe, what's your role?

666
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:35,030
A stand-in, right?

667
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:36,800
A stand-in should be able to play anything...

668
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,720
Don't be so full of youself.

669
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,800
You're just a stand-in.

670
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,760
Why, Tong?

671
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:59,270
Why?
