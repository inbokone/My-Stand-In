1
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,760
After that day,

2
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,400
After that day, Ming avoided me.

3
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:40,280
That time, I thought Ming knew...

4
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,039
that I was the same old Joe.

5
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,280
Joe, I'm sorry.

6
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,039
It's been you all along...

7
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:53,800
Please come back to me, I'm begging you.

8
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,560
But in the end,

9
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,480
it's just about using my back and a replacement for someone.

10
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,000
As always.

11
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,720
Cut!

12
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,360
I think you could do better.

13
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,160
Another take, Joe.

14
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,360
When I realize, my life has repeated itself.

15
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,680
I've become a place for emotional garbage dump of the two people,

16
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,640
who made me die.

17
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,920
Okay.

18
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,160
Oh, sorry, I've just finished packing.

19
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,440
Come with me. I'll give you a ride.

20
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,640
It's alright.

21
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,640
I've told the crew that I'll go with the team's van.

22
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,320
Your Mom's home, right?

23
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,399
I just want to go say hello to her.

24
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,680
I'm back, Mom.

25
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
How was it, are you tired?

26
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,880
A little bit.

27
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,000
Mom, this is Mr. Ming.

28
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,360
He's an investor of the movie that I'm playing.

29
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,000
Hello.

30
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,240
Hello.

31
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,040
I heard that you aren't doing very well.

32
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,520
So I wanted to visit.

33
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,000
Oh.

34
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,240
This is good for your blood.

35
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,520
Thank you.

36
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,760
Excuse me, you look familiar.

37
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,960
Are you...

38
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,640
the presenter that I see often?

39
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,480
You have a great memory

40
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,240
Joe, why didn't you tell me first, so I'd clean up the house?

41
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,640
It's alright, Ms.

42
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,080
I won't be long.

43
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,720
Oh, yes.

44
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,840
Did you take this photo?

45
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,840
Yes.

46
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,920
Joe must be about two or three years old.

47
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,360
And how was he like back then?

48
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,760
Oh, he's a very stubborn kid.

49
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,640
He didn't listen to what I said.

50
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,480
But luckily, he's not like that now.

51
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,360
Why did he change?

52
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,040
I don't know that too.

53
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,320
Because since he's waken up from coma,

54
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,040
he becomes a very good kid. Like a different person.

55
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,160
Er, Mom.

56
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,360
It's time for a dialysis.

57
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,680
Darling, that's about in an hour.

58
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,400
Well, the traffic is bad in the afternoon, Mom.

59
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,600
I think we should go now.

60
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,800
Auntie Nual, auntie Nual.

61
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,160
I think you should take Mom to the hospital now.

62
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,440
Why are you in such a hurry?

63
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,560
Er...Mr...we'll talk again soon, alright?

64
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,120
Right.

65
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,240
Ing, let's go to the hospital.

66
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,720
Alright, take this too.

67
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,080
Thank you.

68
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
See you again later.

69
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,400
Goodbye.

70
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,520
Goodbye.

71
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,120
Take care of your friend.

72
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,520
I will, Mom.

73
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,440
Mr. Ming.

74
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,280
You seem to be more interested in my story...

75
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,000
...than my Mom's well-being.

76
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,400
But it seems like you don't want me to know.

77
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Well, I don't know what exactly you want from me.

78
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,520
How did you know

79
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,480
about how to act in the fencing scene in the first movie?

80
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,760
I just guessed.

81
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,000
You do know, right?

82
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,600
That Tong didn't play that scene himself.

83
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,720
Er...I...I don't know about that.

84
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,200
The person who knew about this had the same name as you.

85
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,760
He had the same figure.

86
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,800
And he worked at the same place as you.

87
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,840
Most importantly, the day that he disappeared,

88
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
was the day that you had an accident.

89
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,720
Do you think that this is all a coincidence?

90
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,840
Well, Mr. Ming...

91
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,800
I don't know what you're trying to say.

92
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,480
Or are you saying...

93
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,720
are you thinking...

94
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,800
that he and I are the same person?

95
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,840
I'm gonna get going now,

96
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,800
I have somewhere to go.

97
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,200
Secretary Jim,

98
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,560
I'm not going to see the detective.

99
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,360
There's someone I want to see more.

100
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,480
Mr. Ming had me collect all the images from the CCTVs....

101
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,400
that were around Joe's place that night.

102
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,560
I believe that the thief must be close to Mr. Joe.

103
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,240
The two may know each other.

104
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,440
And isn't your boss here to see this too?

105
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,040
Mr. Ming has just informed me that he has an urgent errand.

106
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,040
So he told us to proceed.

107
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Sol.

108
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,440
You're the only one who saw the culprit.

109
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,960
If you see someone suspicious, let us know right away.

110
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,160
I will.

111
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,720
Hey, he's not your friend. You can't just come here with a sudden appointment.

112
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,680
And is he here?

113
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,480
I don't know. His student is looking for him now.

114
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,800
Hey, Ming.

115
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,480
What's wrong with him?

116
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,200
I don't know.

117
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,280
Since he's back from shooting a movie out of town,

118
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,880
he's changed.

119
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,760
I didn't go so I don't know what happened.

120
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,960
I think this must involve that new stuntman.

121
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,400
Sip some tea so you'll calm down.

122
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,600
Do you know that I'd come here?

123
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,160
Well, you're here

124
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,640
because you think I know the thing
you're curious about, aren't you?

125
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,640
I met someone...

126
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,400
He seems so much like Joe.

127
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
So much that I thought...

128
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,360
he might be the same person...

129
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,000
But how would that be possible?

130
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,800
You were the one who told me that...

131
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,000
Joe is not dead nor alive.

132
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,560
Then please, Master, tell me where he is.

133
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,080
I really can't take this anymore.

134
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,200
Please.

135
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,720
I will tell you...

136
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,920
only if you come meditate with me first.

137
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,440
Please, Master, tell me.

138
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,200
I can only tell you about the direction.

139
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,200
But you must walk that path yourself.

140
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,680
If you don't know, just say so.

141
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,920
It's alright

142
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,280
if you won't help me.

143
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,200
I'll find the answer myself.

144
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
We've seen all of these...

145
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,360
and haven't found anyone yet.

146
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,640
That night, Sol was confused about the time too.

147
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,000
So we had to rewatch everything again.

148
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,240
Starting from 11 p.m. till 5 a.m.

149
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,560
I think this is the most suspicious one.

150
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,640
Sol,

151
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,240
does he look like the one you saw that night?

152
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,640
Who's that?

153
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,520
How dare you break into this house?

154
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,440
Do you know whose house this is?

155
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,920
So?

156
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,480
Is it him?

157
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,680
Er...

158
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,040
No.

159
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,000
That day, he wasn't wearing this outfit.

160
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,120
Are you sure?

161
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,200
Yes, let's continue.

162
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,040
Please wait here.

163
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,960
I'll call you.

164
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,920
Yes.

165
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,240
Thank you.

166
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,240
Joe, this hospital looks so elegant.

167
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,960
Is it expensive?

168
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,200
It's alright, Mom.
I can handle this for you.

169
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,040
Hello, Auntie Ing.

170
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,800
Oh.

171
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,440
Wut.

172
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,640
Hello. /  Hello.

173
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,880
I heard from Joe that you're going to be here.

174
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,560
So I came to visit.

175
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,160
Thank you so much.

176
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,560
Wow, it's been a long time,
you're doing good, Wut?

177
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,640
Yes, I'm good.

178
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,440
How about your Dad?

179
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,360
My Dad is okay now too.

180
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,160
Ma'am, this way, please.

181
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,200
Oh, right, right.

182
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,600
Go, I'll follow you.

183
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,640
Alright,

184
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,360
see you later.

185
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,480
Yes, Mom.

186
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,840
Goodbye, Mrs. Ing.

187
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,280
Have you eaten?

188
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,320
I'm thinking about going out
to find something for my Mom to eat.

189
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,160
Do you wanna tag along?

190
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,080
Mmm,

191
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,720
I'm not hungry.

192
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,640
You didn't come here because of my Mom, did you?

193
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,680
You know, there are so many rumors now.

194
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,960
You and Ming are very close.

195
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,840
Is there anything I should know about?

196
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,200
Well,

197
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,600
Right now, I'm Mr. Ming's paramour.

198
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,640
You're a fool!

199
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,120
Why would you do that?

200
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,840
Fame?

201
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,680
Money?

202
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,080
Huh?

203
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,880
For money.

204
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,560
And for my Mom.

205
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,080
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

206
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,600
And you'll regret this.

207
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,400
You came see me because of this, right?

208
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,560
I went to see images from CCTVs,

209
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,800
of Joe's house being intruded.

210
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,280
And you know what,

211
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,760
no one was suspicious.

212
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,040
As if Ghost Joe came in
and visited his own place.

213
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,640
What?

214
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,520
That's weird.

215
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,600
Yeah, and there are so many weird things.

216
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,840
You know that Jojo's wife is a great cook.

217
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,680
And you told them that I told you about it.

218
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,920
Hey, Joe,

219
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,000
I'd never said it.

220
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,640
Why did you lie?

221
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,640
Huh?

222
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,359
Sorry, I might have mistaken it
for something else.

223
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,079
Like when you remembered
that I got twins?

224
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,880
Joe, tell me the truth.

225
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,480
Talk to me, loud and clear. Now!

226
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,880
Who the fuck are you?

227
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,160
Why do you have so many things

228
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,440
in common with the person I used to know?

229
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,440
Hey,

230
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,600
tell me.

231
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,480
Er...I...

232
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,680
Mr. Ming is calling for me now.

233
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,480
And Auntie Nual isn't home today,
so I gotta bring my Mom home.

234
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,600
Go wherever you need to go. I'm sorry.

235
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,080
Shit, I don't know what the fuck is going on now.

236
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,600
I'm so confused.

237
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,440
Go.

238
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,720
It's alright.

239
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,240
Wait,

240
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,400
are you free the day after tomorrow?

241
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,720
There's an event coming.

242
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,200
The money's good. Come with me.

243
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,360
I'm busy on that day.

244
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,480
I'm sorry.

245
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,880
But thank you so much.

246
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,680
Alright, off you go. Talk to you later.

247
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,480
Goodbye

248
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,760
Oh, Wut.

249
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,240
You're here to check on me?

250
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,960
Guys, leave us.

251
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,840
I got something to talk to Sol.

252
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,800
Tell me, you actually saw
who the thief in the CCTV was, right?

253
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,120
Hey, I've already told you,

254
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,960
I don't see anyone.

255
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,680
Sol.

256
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,720
How many years have I known you?

257
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,400
Do you think you can lie to me?

258
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,800
And the guy that you saw...

259
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,440
was the new Joe, right?

260
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm sorry for being late.

261
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,040
I had to drop my Mom off at the hospital.

262
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,400
Have you eaten?

263
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,720
A bit.

264
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,240
Cook for me.

265
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,080
I've prepared the stuff for you already.

266
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,640
Mr. Ming, if you're hungry,

267
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,920
would you like me to
order something for you to eat?

268
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,560
I want you to cook for me.

269
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,240
You haven't eaten anything, right?

270
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,760
Oh, wait, wait.

271
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,800
Here...

272
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,280
This is my recipe.

273
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,800
Oh, wait.

274
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,680
How is it? Can you eat that?

275
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,720
It's the same flavor I used to have.

276
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,640
I think anyone who makes
instant noodles, gets the same flavor.

277
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,360
But there's something...

278
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,080
that's unlike any noodles, definitely.

279
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,960
What is that?

280
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,640
I'll know when I finish this.

281
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,200
Mr. Ming.

282
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,440
This is my restroom.

283
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,720
How could I not come in?

284
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,840
Mr. Ming.

285
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,800
Mr. Ming!

286
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,600
Joe,

287
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,840
who exactly are you?

288
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,440
I've already told you who I am.

289
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,120
And why are you so much like him?

290
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,800
Just tell me.

291
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,800
I can't take this anymore.

292
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,240
Tell me the truth, please, I'm begging you.

293
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,400
Mr. Ming.

294
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,960
If I were to tell you that I was him,

295
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,840
would you believe me, Mr. Ming?

296
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,760
How would that kind of thing be possible?

297
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,920
Mr. Ming, accept it,

298
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,760
that Joe's dead.

299
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,360
Joe is not dead!

300
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,120
He is!

301
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,920
He is not!

302
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,680
He is!

303
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,160
He is not!

304
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,440
Get out!

305
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,400
Get out now!

306
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,400
If I meditate,

307
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,280
would you really tell me where Joe is?

308
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,600
Today, I brought you soup.

309
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,440
You both can't remember me, right?

310
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,120
But this is Joe.

311
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,600
I'm so sorry

312
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,760
for not being able to take care
of the body you created.

313
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,800
Actually, I was supposed to be with you guys.

314
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,840
But I don't know why I got into this Joe's body.

315
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,840
But yeah, right now, I'm still alive.

316
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,720
And there're people I need to take care.

317
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,480
So all I can do is...the best that I can do.

318
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,760
But don't you worry.

319
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,080
Not long, one day,
I'll be with you, Mom and Dad.

320
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,360
Joe.

321
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Is it really you?

322
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,200
Wut!

323
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,560
Wut, Wut, Wut, Wut, Wut!

324
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,360
Wut! / Come here!

325
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,440
I told you not to go, didn't I?

326
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,080
Why didn't you listen to me?

327
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,440
And why the fuck did you come back here?

328
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,840
I told you if you went,
we weren't gonna be bros again.

329
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,280
Wut, Wut, Wut, Wut, Wut!

330
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,800
Wut! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

331
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,120
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

332
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,040
Do you know...

333
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,920
how much everyone misses you?

334
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,560
I'm sorry.

335
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,000
I'm so sorry.

336
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,960
You're back!

337
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,280
You're back!

338
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,920
Right, Joe,

339
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,400
you're back!

340
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,360
I'm back.

341
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,120
I'm back here now.

342
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,960
I'm here.

343
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,840
I'm sorry.

344
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,600
It's alright.

345
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,080
How long do I have to sit here?

346
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,520
Each person takes different durations
to get to the top of the hill.

347
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,000
Some get there slow, some fast.

348
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,320
But they'll know they're at the top

349
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,120
when they see the horizon.

350
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,200
Good whiskey.

351
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,080
Thanks.

352
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:07,400
Joe, if it weren't for your parents,

353
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,600
I'd knock you out.

354
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,720
I'm sorry.

355
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,840
That's enough.

356
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,320
You've said sorry for hundreds of times already.

357
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,120
Why didn't you tell me
when you were in the hospital?

358
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,720
You wanted me to tell you?

359
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,680
Let's give it a try...

360
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,520
Wut, hello.

361
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,280
Wut, it's me, Joe.

362
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,880
Joe, your bro.

363
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,600
But now, I'm stuck in this body.

364
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,600
Please believe me, Wut.

365
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,400
Please.

366
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,560
A fool would believe that.

367
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,440
Right, if that really happened,

368
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,760
I would send you to the brain department
to have your brain scanned.

369
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,080
See? If I told you,
you wouldn't believe me anyway.

370
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,520
But I wanted to tell you all everyday.

371
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,520
I just didn't know how.

372
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,920
But right now,

373
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,240
I'm so relieved.

374
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,360
Who wrote the script of your life, man?

375
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,040
We reunited.

376
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,160
And it's all the same team.

377
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,320
Tong...

378
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,640
Ming...

379
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,440
What's this?

380
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,880
I know.

381
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,960
I guess I haven't paid for the karma I did to them.

382
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,240
But it's alright.

383
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,960
At least, this time...

384
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,920
My goal tells me for whom I'm going to live.

385
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,200
You're so nice.

386
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,640
You're doing this for her,

387
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,560
and she's not even your real mother.

388
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,200
Mrs. Ing is being so nice to me,
and I'm not even her real son.

389
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,160
This means a lot to an orphan like me,
you know, Sol.

390
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,960
Anyway...

391
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,480
Just you being alive, is good enough.

392
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,360
That was a nice thing to say.

393
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,800
Therefore, tonight,

394
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,440
cheers!

395
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,680
And guys...

396
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,120
If you're not drunk tonight,
you can't go home!

397
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:40,840
Cheers!

398
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,040
And the food's already here,
and you guys aren't eating it.

399
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,640
Even I didn't have any evidence other than words.

400
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,960
But they believed me, wholeheartedly.

401
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,800
I guess this is what's called...

402
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,240
a bond.

403
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,080
You might think I'm crazy.

404
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,400
But deep down, I still have hope...

405
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,120
that my body is still out there somewhere.

406
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,520
Maybe that body is sleeping
in a coma, somewhere.

407
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,880
And one day,

408
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,360
I'm going to switch into
that same old Joe's body.

409
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,280
I think...

410
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,040
You've watched too many movies.

411
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,480
Nolan is really good,
but it's an imaginary world.

412
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,920
Eat.

413
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,920
Whiskey! More whiskey!

414
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,640
Actually, you didn't have to give me a ride.

415
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,360
I didn't wanna bother you.

416
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,200
You being like this,
it's just like the old Joe.

417
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,600
Well, I'm gonna get going now.

418
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,880
Hey, Joe.

419
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,160
Huh?

420
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,360
Can I go in to visit your Mom?

421
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,560
Mom!

422
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,360
I'm back!

423
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,440
Hello.

424
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,440
Hello.

425
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,280
Let's see who gave me a ride home, Mom.

426
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,720
Hello. Hello.

427
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,680
Er...

428
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,680
Sol...the one...

429
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,400
that you were with in his music video, right?

430
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,120
Oh, you know me?

431
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,760
Oh, of course, I know you.
Please, welcome.

432
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,040
Please, sit here.

433
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,280
Welcome.

434
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,800
Hey, do you know that
Nual and I are your fans.

435
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,280
Thank you.

436
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,800
And your music videos,

437
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,160
we've replayed them so many times, right?

438
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:17,960
Really?

439
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,520
Yes.

440
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,760
Thank you very much.

441
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,040
Er...can I take a selfie with you?

442
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,840
I'll show it to the nurses.

443
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,320
Of course.

444
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,240
I'll get you all some water.

445
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,400
Alright.

446
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,760
May I?

447
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,680
Mom! Keep your cool.

448
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,360
Son, I'm this old. I don't need to be shy.

449
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,120
Ah, let's do it. One. Two. Three.

450
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,040
Wow, you're so handsome.

451
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,040
Right, my crew sent me
the first draft of the music video...

452
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,400
Would you like to see it?

453
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,880
Yes!

454
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,560
Here. This is it.

455
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,280
Let's see...

456
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,560
Wow,

457
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,520
Sol, you're so handsome.

458
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,680
You shine so bright, like, wow.

459
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,000
Not that much...

460
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,440
For real.

461
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:30,080
Mom, I'm in the video too.

462
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,280
Why aren't you talking about me at all?

463
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,720
Oh, there you are, Joe.

464
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,800
So?

465
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,200
You're handsome too.

466
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,000
But Sol...your smile...it's so sweet.
Looking so good.

467
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,680
Oh, no.

468
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,640
Look at him, look at him!

469
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,680
Joe, well, you're alright too.

470
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,920
Can I beat Sol?

471
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,120
Well...you're alright, you're alright.

472
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,920
Sol, it's because of you, see?

473
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,240
My mom ignored me!

474
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,920
But to me, you're always important.

475
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,400
I know that. I was just kidding.

476
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,240
But I'm being serious.

477
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Joe.

478
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,200
Let me clear off your debts.

479
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,280
So you can be free from him.

480
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,400
Thanks, Sol.

481
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,880
But I've chosen this path.

482
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,000
And I gotta be responsible for it.

483
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,040
Do you really think so

484
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,120
or do you still have feelings for him?

485
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,840
Sol,

486
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,360
my feelings,

487
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,800
they're dead with my old body.

488
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,360
I have a chance to come back...

489
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,960
I won't risk myself to get hurt like that again.

490
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,760
What's wrong with you?

491
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,080
Is it really you?

492
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,040
I can't believe it.

493
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,800
I can't believe that I'd get to see you again.

494
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,000
Thank you for not forgetting about me.

495
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,760
I'll never forget about you.

496
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,320
Joe is not dead...

497
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,560
nor alive...

498
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,920
Wait.

499
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,920
Have we met before?

500
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,080
I think you've mistaken me for someone else.

501
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,360
Wait.

502
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,600
What's your name?

503
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,920
My name is Joe.

504
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,840
Why did he change?

505
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,880
I don't know that too.

506
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,640
Because since he's waken up from coma,

507
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,840
he becomes a very good kid.
Like a different person.

508
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,880
And

509
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,320
action!

510
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,480
It's not so different from the old guy.

511
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,440
It's all the same.

512
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,040
Who told you that?

513
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,040
From the back,
he looks exactly like Tong.

514
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,040
How is it? Can you eat?

515
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,840
It's the same flavor I used to have.

516
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,800
The person who knew about
this had the same name as you.

517
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,040
He had the same figure.

518
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,120
And he worked at the same place as you.

519
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,840
Most importantly,

520
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,800
the day that he disappeared,

521
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,960
was the day that you had an accident.

522
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,640
Do you think it's all a coincidence?

523
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,120
Joe, I'm sorry.

524
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,400
It's always been you, all along.

525
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,400
Please come back to me,

526
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,400
I'm begging you.

527
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,720
If I told you that I was him,

528
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,360
would you believe me, Mr. Ming?

529
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,520
Have you got the answer?

530
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,600
It's the opposite.

531
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,720
I've got so many questions.

532
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,960
Impossible questions.

533
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,600
Or the answer is very clear itself?

534
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,240
And you just can't accept it?

535
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,120
But those answers...

536
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,760
are hard to believe too.

537
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,840
The truth...

538
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,960
sometimes, you cannot see it with your eyes.

539
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,280
And what should I do?

540
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,520
Ask yourself.

541
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,800
If there's something wrong,
please call us right away.

542
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,240
I will, thank you.

543
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,280
Thank you.

544
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,840
Are you cold, Mom?
I'll cover you with the blanket.

545
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,000
Thank you, darling.

546
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:54,160
Eh...You seem happy these days.

547
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,120
Is there anything?

548
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,600
Nothing.

549
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,120
I'm happy because
I see you get better each day.

550
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,120
Not because that singer gave you a ride home?

551
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,320
You mean, Sol?

552
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,560
Yeah.

553
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,280
C'mon, I'm an old lady.

554
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,840
I can tell that he likes my son.

555
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,960
But...do you like him?

556
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,080
Mom, I got so much work.
I don't have time to take care of anyone else.

557
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,360
Joe. I'm old.

558
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,040
I...would like someone to take care of you

559
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,560
when I'm not around anymore.

560
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,000
Mom, why did you say that?

561
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,560
You're still healthy.

562
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,760
You gotta be with me
for a long long time, alright?

563
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,880
I just wanna get to see who's going to
take care of you instead of me.

564
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,280
Just you being happy,
I'm okay with anyone.

565
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,080
Thank you, Mom.

566
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,760
Right, Mom...

567
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,400
you used to tell me that...

568
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,200
my Dad died when I was little, right?

569
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,920
Yeah, I think you were...

570
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,720
about seven years old.

571
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,720
Seven years old.

572
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,160
Then, you only had a few years with him.

573
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,240
If you could turn back time,

574
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:30,320
would you change your mind
and choose someone else?

575
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,680
If it were your Dad, Joe,

576
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,840
no matter how many times
I had to turn back time,

577
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,720
I would still choose your Dad.

578
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,200
Yes, Mom.

579
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,280
You're the sweetest.

580
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,240
Speaking of him makes me miss him.

581
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,520
Just a sec.

582
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,560
Come see me ASAP.

583
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,200
Please.

584
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,360
I was the one who called you.

585
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,880
I'm Mike, Ming's brother.

586
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,520
Yes.

587
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,520
And is there anything you want to talk to me?

588
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,240
I just want to see with my own eyes...

589
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,040
the person who...

590
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,840
made my brother go meditate.

591
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,520
What do you mean?

592
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,680
What's your name?

593
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,640
My name is Joe.

594
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:22,440
Oh, that's why he's into you.

595
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,240
I'm just a toy for you brother
to play with when he's lonely.

596
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,280
A toy that's worth
five million Baht and a house?

597
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,120
Isn't that too expensive?

598
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,200
It's just a piece of money to you all.

599
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,400
But for me,

600
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,640
it changes my life and my Mom's too.

601
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,760
But don't you worry...

602
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,400
because one year after this...

603
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,920
I won't come see your brother anymore.

604
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,040
How can I believe that
you're gonna keep your promise?

605
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,880
Well, your kind of people...

606
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,680
Making one stuntman disappear...

607
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,880
isn't so difficult, right?

608
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,120
You should worry about your brother.

609
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,880
Is he going to let me go or not?

610
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,800
Well.

611
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,880
You don't seem like
you're a golddigger I used to meet.

612
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,200
What are you doing here?

613
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,880
You let him in?

614
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,040
I'm sorry, Mr. Ming.

615
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,960
I had Secretary Jim call him in.

616
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,640
Who told you to mess with my life?

617
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,240
Then, I guess...excuse me.

618
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,080
Wait.

619
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,880
You must come with me.

620
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,000
Do not follow us.

621
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,040
We're going alone.

622
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,720
Whose car is this?

623
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,120
Get in.

624
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,600
And where would you like me to go?

625
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,640
Just take me anywhere.

626
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,200
Mr. Ming.

627
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,360
I don't know where to take you.

628
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,440
If you don't know where to take me,

629
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,720
there's one place I want to go.

630
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,480
I wanna get up there.

631
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,800
Are you sure, Mr. Ming?

632
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,040
Why, don't you want to?

633
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,240
Mr. Ming, I think it looks dangerous.

634
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,920
We...we should go back, Mr. Ming.

635
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,040
Walk carefully. My place is a little dark.

636
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,760
This time,

637
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,400
I can't tell if the feelings that I have...

638
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,880
belongs to this body...

639
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,880
or the old body...

640
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,800
But no matter what,

641
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,120
I guess it doesn't matter anymore.

642
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,880
Has Wut ever told you...

643
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,280
that the old Joe's house was intruded?

644
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,840
Yeah.

645
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,760
The detective said that
there's no trace of damage on the door.

646
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,640
That means the thief
used the spare key to get in.

647
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,680
And in this world...

648
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,040
the people who know
where the spare key is are...

649
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,600
me,

650
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,200
Sol...

651
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,840
and you.

652
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,480
Right, Joe?

653
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,400
Mr. Ming!

654
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,640
Could you stop joking?

655
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,960
I've already told you Mr. Ming is d...

656
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,160
Not dead!

657
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,480
Nor alive!

658
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,480
Because he's back in the new body.

659
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,320
Mr. Ming, what are you talking about?

660
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,280
You could lie to me

661
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,240
but your body told me all the answers.

662
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,360
There's only one person....

663
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,720
who sneezes when reaching orgasms.

664
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,320
Ming, do you like doing it from the back?

665
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,680
And you don't like it?

666
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,080
What?

667
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,720
We've found Joe.

668
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,440
Are you sure?

669
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,320
Yes, Mr. Ming.

670
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,720
They've found Joe.
