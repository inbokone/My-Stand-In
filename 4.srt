1
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,680
Did you take me home?

2
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,320
No.

3
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,919
You came home by yourself.

4
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,920
Really?

5
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,200
I don't recall that.

6
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,280
But I do.

7
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
What?

8
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
That's your breakfast.

9
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,120
I'm gonna get going.

10
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,120
Joe.

11
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,240
Are you gonna be home late tonight?

12
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,320
Not sure yet.

13
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,920
Can you not postpone the shooting?

14
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,480
No! I won't let that happen this time.

15
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,960
But this is my wedding.

16
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,240
They really are fighting now. Just like you predicted.

17
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,000
But this time, the shooting still hasn't happened yet.

18
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,600
Can you see? The shooting schedule!

19
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,680
Ass, have you ever felt sorry for the crew?

20
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,840
They don't have the money from being the brand presenters like you do.

21
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,960
Pao.

22
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,360
Calm down.

23
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,079
I really understand you both.

24
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,800
But the best way is...

25
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,240
why don't we help fix the problem?

26
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,600
I'm not going to postpone anything.

27
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,000
If anyone doesn't show up at the press conference,

28
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,360
then that person won't be in the movie.

29
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,160
Okay.

30
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,640
If you say so, Pao, then so be it.

31
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,800
But I hope you'll find suitable replacement.

32
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Tong.

33
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
You think there's none?

34
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,040
Joe.

35
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,399
You've been his stand-in for a long time.

36
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,840
But this time, I'll give you the leading role instead.

37
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,920
You gotta be responsible for this.

38
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,520
Yes.

39
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
I understand that, sir.

40
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,560
What did he say?

41
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,760
He didn't want a fight.

42
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,280
So he said it's your call.

43
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What? Wut! How can I be the one who makes a decision?

44
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,560
Why couldn't he wait for Pao to calm down first?

45
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,200
And then talk again?

46
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,520
I've know him for a long time.

47
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,760
A guy like him is very uptight.

48
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,600
Either Pao or Tong will have to go.

49
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,280
Then, who will he choose?

50
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,000
The big guy will always choose another big guy.

51
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:39,560
Pao has been working with him for a long time.

52
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,520
Seriously, this time, it's totally Tong's fault.

53
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
Then...

54
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,360
this movie will have a new leading male to replace Tong, right?

55
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Actually, Joe, I want to push you to be that person.

56
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,720
But it must not happen like this.

57
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,200
Tong's fans will try to drag you down.

58
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
Why would you risk yourself?

59
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,640
Tong.

60
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,800
Why didn't you choose me?

61
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,080
But I wanna show Tong's fans that...

62
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,320
I'm going to be the leading role in this movie instead of Tong.

63
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
Yes.

64
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,159
I understand, sir.

65
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,040
I'll talk to him, yes, yes.

66
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
How was it?

67
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,200
Shit, he scolded the shit out of you.

68
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,840
Well, at first he said it's your call...

69
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,240
you know why?

70
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,480
Because he thought you would reject it.

71
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,360
Then, I'll...

72
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,800
Well, he agrees to let you take this.

73
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,080
But,...

74
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,320
if you screw this up,

75
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,680
you won't get away with it for sure.

76
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,320
So, Joe, I'm asking you to reconsider one more time.

77
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,360
You can still say no.

78
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,840
No.

79
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,640
I can't back down anymore.

80
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,640
Can't back down? Why?

81
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,040
Can I sleep at your place tonight?

82
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,680
I'll tell you everything.

83
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,920
Ja, we're here.

84
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,480
Hey, Joe will spend a night here too.

85
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,360
Ja, hello.

86
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,920
Hello.

87
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,440
How are you doing? It's been so long since we last met. Are you good?

88
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,440
I'm fine, Ja. I'm doing good.

89
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,240
Oh, good.

90
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,320
Wow, that's a big stomach.

91
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,400
How could it not be? Wut gave me two.

92
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,600
Oh, you guys got twins?

93
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,000
Well, aren't I just good?

94
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,960
C'mon, sit down, I'll find something for you to eat.

95
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,960
Do you need a hand?

96
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,240
No, it's alright, we're good.

97
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,960
Sit down.

98
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,960
Thank you.

99
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,280
Here, you carry this light stuff.

100
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,480
Can you hold it?

101
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,480
Oh, just kidding!

102
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,440
You're so naughty.

103
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,600
Joe.

104
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,880
Oh, thank you.

105
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,960
Here are some snacks for you.

106
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,000
Wut.

107
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,520
That international production,...

108
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,840
they called and asked us for a stunt team.

109
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,720
No. You must say no to them.

110
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,840
That kind of production is unlicensed.

111
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,160
Don't get involved with them.

112
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,400
Yeah, I know that.

113
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,960
Make yourself at home.

114
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,800
I'll be going now.

115
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,880
Thank you.

116
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,680
Do you need me?

117
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,000
No, it's alright.

118
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,960
Walk carefully.

119
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,200
I will.

120
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,120
So, Joe, what is it?

121
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,000
What happened?

122
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,120
Well...

123
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,280
Ming and I broke up.

124
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,040
Wait, what?

125
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,000
Is this about his family?

126
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,040
Well, that too. But the main thing is...

127
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,840
he only dated me because I'm Tong's stand-in.

128
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,280
Shit.

129
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,280
Is this the reason why you're insisting on playing this movie?

130
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,120
I just want to make other people know that...

131
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,640
what Tong can do, I can do it too.

132
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,000
But I'm happy.

133
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,360
So you'll no longer be involved with that kind of person.

134
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,760
Well, actually, we haven't cleared things up yet.

135
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,920
I left home earlier.

136
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,400
And now I'm here at your place.

137
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,800
Don't be serious.

138
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,000
Cheers!

139
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,840
Let's drink. Everything shall pass.

140
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,040
What? Speaking of the devil...

141
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,680
Clear things up now, Joe.

142
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,520
The day after tomorrow is your new movie press conference day.

143
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,440
Don't be distracted by anything else.

144
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,120
Alright, I'll answer the phone first.

145
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,520
Hello, Ming.

146
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,520
Hello.

147
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,960
Where are you?

148
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,760
Why didn't you answer any of my calls today?

149
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
I'm kinda busy today.

150
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,000
And...when are you going home?

151
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,520
I'll wait for you to pack your things and leave first. And I'll come home.

152
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,560
What?

153
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Pack your things and leave my house.

154
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,720
Are you kicking me out?

155
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,000
Are you really kicking me out?

156
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,480
You heard it.

157
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
You think you can get away from me?

158
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,120
Have your packed your things and left my place yet?

159
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,440
Ming.

160
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,760
Ming.

161
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,720
You told me to move in, I moved in.

162
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,120
And now, you're kicking me out?

163
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,560
What am I to you?

164
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,360
And how about you?

165
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,800
What am I to you?

166
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,760
Tong's stand-in?

167
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
What are you talking about?

168
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,920
On the Christmas night,

169
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,120
You hugged me from behind.

170
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,960
And called me Tong.

171
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,440
What?

172
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,920
So you're heartbroken, huh?

173
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,960
He just proposed to her.

174
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,800
That's my personal stuff.

175
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,840
Don't get involved.

176
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,360
I don't want to get involved, Ming.

177
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,920
I just want to end things.

178
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,640
Pack your things and get out of my house.

179
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,640
And don't you ever come see me again, Ming.

180
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,160
You have no right to give me an order.

181
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,240
I tell you to come home.

182
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,840
Then you must come home.

183
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,240
No, you, go home.

184
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,240
Sol.

185
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,720
This doesn't involve you, asshole.

186
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,840
Hey!

187
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,720
Ming! Sol!

188
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,200
Ming!

189
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,520
Sol!

190
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,840
Sol, stop!

191
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,920
Stop!

192
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,760
Ming!

193
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,760
Stop it!

194
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,320
Both of you, stop!

195
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,920
Sol!

196
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,560
Hey, hey!

197
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,800
Ming.

198
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,760
Hey!

199
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,960
Stop it!

200
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,320
Get out of my office now!

201
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,080
Don't make me call security.

202
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,720
This isn't over yet.

203
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,600
Hey, Joe.

204
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,800
Haven't I told you...

205
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,600
that you need to clear things up?

206
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,040
I'm sorry, Wut.

207
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,880
I'm really sorry.

208
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,720
Tomorrow is the press conference day.

209
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,000
Are you gonna clear this mess yourself or should I clear it for you?

210
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,320
Tonight, I'm gonna clear things up with him at home.

211
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,680
I'll go with you.

212
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,240
I don't trust him.

213
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,960
Don't, Sol.

214
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,400
I'll do it myself.

215
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,400
So you've finally come home?

216
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,560
You still haven't packed your stuff?

217
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,680
So you're really gonna do this?

218
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,840
I'm telling you...

219
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,120
in this life, you won't be able to find a better boyfriend than me.

220
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,000
Right.

221
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,120
Then why are you wasting your time with me?

222
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,960
If you don't pack your things,

223
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,280
I'll do it.

224
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
Ming.

225
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,000
Ming.

226
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,360
Joe. / Let go.

227
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,360
Joe.

228
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,080
Can you forget everything and go back to the way we were?

229
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,600
We were so happy together before this, weren't we?

230
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,680
Were we?

231
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,760
Are you sure?

232
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,280
If we were really happy together,

233
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,840
would you think of other people when we did it?

234
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,240
I'm sorry.

235
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,280
I'm sorry.

236
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,600
It's not your fault, Ming.

237
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,000
It's my fault.

238
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,000
I didn't know that I was just a stand-in.

239
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,400
Don't you love me anymore?

240
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,640
Ming.

241
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
I'll tell you something, Ming.

242
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,200
Although I'm not as good as Tong,

243
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,080
but I got my dignity.

244
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,640
I don't want to be just a stand-in on and off the screen, understood?

245
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,560
Joe.

246
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,680
Joe.

247
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,920
Let me go, Ming.

248
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,400
Leave me with good memory to think of.

249
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,440
Please, some good memories for me to think of.

250
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,280
Is that Tong calling?

251
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,960
Answer it.

252
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,000
He doesn't like to wait.

253
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,760
Yes, Tong?

254
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,240
I was fired from the project by the director.

255
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,360
And he will replace me with Joe.

256
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
What?

257
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,040
I think this is Wut's plan for sure.

258
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,160
He wants to push his people to be famous.

259
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,520
Before this, he pushed Sol to get a supporting role.

260
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,480
And now, Joe, as a leading role.

261
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,520
So they would be an imaginary pair.

262
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,080
Sol?

263
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,280
Yes.

264
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,600
Ming, help me.

265
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,040
Tomorrow, there's a press conference.

266
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,840
Do whatever you can...

267
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,320
and stop Joe from going to the conference.

268
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,840
I'm not gonna let a stand-in replace me.

269
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,160
Tong, don't you worry.

270
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,160
As long as I'm here,

271
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,640
he can't go anywhere.

272
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,800
So you said dignity?

273
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,000
Actually, you're gonne leave me to play a movie with that Oppa of yours.

274
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,520
What are you talking about, Ming?

275
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,320
You think I don't know?

276
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,720
Your new movie...

277
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
You gotta play with him...

278
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,960
Oh, so that's why, this morning, he stuck his nose in.

279
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,120
And last night, when you didn't come home...

280
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,600
you were sleeping with him, right?

281
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,440
Ming!

282
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,520
Are you insane?!

283
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,040
Is it him calling?

284
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,360
Hello, Sol.

285
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,680
It's me Joe. I'm just worried.

286
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,800
You didn't answer my calls, so I'm heading to your place.

287
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,840
Everything is fine, Sol.

288
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,480
You don't have to come.

289
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,080
We've cleared things up.

290
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,080
Alright.

291
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,200
Ming!

292
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,600
What the hell did you do?!

293
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,440
Where are we, Ming?

294
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,480
You thought I would be so stupid to lock you at your place,
so people could come find you?

295
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Ming.

296
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Ming, please let me go.

297
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,680
If I didn't go to this conference, everyone would be in trouble.

298
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,480
As long as I am here,

299
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,760
you won't be able to go anywhere.

300
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
You won't get to see Sol.

301
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,360
You seem to be in a good mood today.

302
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,760
At last, I finally get to play with Joe.

303
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,160
And this time, he gets to be the main lead.

304
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,160
Hey, Yim.

305
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,200
Has Joe called you yet?

306
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,640
Nope.

307
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,640
What's up?

308
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,760
He just disappeared.

309
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,920
I called, and he didn't answer.

310
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,200
I'll look for him at his place.

311
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,360
No need to, Sol.

312
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,800
You stay here. I'll handle this.

313
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
Yim, if he calls, let me know right away, alright?

314
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,640
Okay, got it. / Okay.

315
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,080
Sol, are you alright?

316
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
Joe.

317
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,120
Eat.

318
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,400
You know...

319
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,520
you're about to destroy everything I've built.

320
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,360
And so?

321
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,320
I can give you as much fund as you need to be the lead character in any movie.

322
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,320
But please just stay with me.

323
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,960
That's right.

324
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,360
Just Tong getting his role back,

325
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,360
you would do anything, right?

326
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,960
You just don't understand a thing.

327
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,320
Who told you that, Ming?

328
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,560
All these times, it's I who haven't seen it.

329
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
I should have listened to Sol in the first place.

330
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,400
You really wanna go see him, right?

331
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,760
Alright.

332
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,760
I'm gonna make you stuck here with me forever.

333
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,760
Pao, I'm so sorry, I'm really sorry.

334
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,480
But Joe will be here in a sec, trust me.

335
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,120
And where the hell is he now?

336
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,080
Well, we can't reach him now, but normally...

337
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,880
Shut up, you asshole!

338
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,440
Fuck it, do you know in my entire career in this industry,

339
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,240
no one has ever dared do such a thing to me.

340
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,520
Watch out...after this conference...

341
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,240
Not just Joe, but you, you won't have your place
in this industry anymore, Wut!

342
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,760
Pao, wait, Pao...

343
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,280
Joe, damn you!

344
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,960
Hello.

345
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,080
I'm here to congratulate.

346
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,080
Is everything alright?

347
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,680
Tong.

348
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,040
Did you do anything to Joe?

349
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,480
What could I do?

350
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,120
Calm down.

351
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,120
I'm just here to congratulate.

352
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,400
Here. A bouquet for you.

353
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,560
Ming.

354
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,600
No matter what, I'm not gonna let you go anywhere.

355
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,120
It's not about that.

356
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,400
I have something to ask you for a long time.

357
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
If you really like Tong,

358
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,200
why would you care about things between Me and Sol?

359
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,760
It's because you're mine.

360
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,680
I was just a sex doll when you missed Tong, right?

361
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,840
That's not it.

362
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,720
Seriously, Ming.

363
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,640
All these times, have you ever loved me?

364
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,240
You can't tell?

365
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,840
All the time that we were together,...

366
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,640
and you really couldn't tell?

367
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,120
Stay with me, please.

368
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,600
I'll give you everything you need.

369
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,400
Ming, you know...

370
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,720
what I need the most is...

371
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,960
you, Ming.

372
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,640
I just want to hold you, Ming.

373
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,600
Ming, Ming, wait.

374
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,840
Today, can I be the one behind you instead?

375
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,880
Or do you still see me as Tong's stand-in?

376
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,800
Alright.

377
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Hey!

378
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
Hey! Joe!

379
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
Joe!

380
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,280
Joe! / Stop it!

381
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,240
You don't love me.

382
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,400
The only one you love is Tong.

383
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,520
Joe.

384
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,720
Joe!

385
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,480
Joe, please!

386
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,160
Joe!

387
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,520
Shit!

388
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,480
Wut.

389
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,440
Wut.

390
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,320
Wut.

391
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,680
You, shithead, Joe.

392
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,360
Wut.

393
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,800
You still have the guts to show up here?

394
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,440
Wait.

395
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,040
Wut, talk to him nicely.

396
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,680
I'm sorry.

397
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,000
Calm down first.

398
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,000
The thing is...Ming locked me up.

399
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Huh?

400
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,480
That's what I thought. If it didn't happen like that,

401
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,360
you wouldn't just disappear.

402
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,760
But...really, he did this to you?

403
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
Wait.

404
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,680
Is Tong involved?

405
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I don't know.

406
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,760
I'm don't know anything but I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

407
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,720
We are not troubled.

408
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,560
But you are.

409
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,880
Boss is furious.

410
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,200
He put your name on the black list.

411
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,880
That means no agencies will need you anymore.

412
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,160
And what should I do?

413
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,800
Ja, what should I do?

414
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,920
In this life, I only know how to be a stuntman.

415
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,480
I've never done anything else in my life.

416
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,440
Wut.

417
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,760
I'm sorry, Joe.

418
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,320
But this time, I really can't help you.

419
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,520
It's alright.

420
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,480
If I can't do it here, I'll do it somewhere else.

421
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,440
That international production...

422
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,600
Wut, Ja, they need a stunt, right?

423
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,640
Please, Wut.

424
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,080
Are you nuts? You do know...

425
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,920
that this kind of production is gangsters.

426
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,720
They do money laundering. They aren't licensed.

427
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,520
Joe, listen, Joe.

428
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,400
I used to be a stunt in this kind of production.

429
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,320
Their tools don't meet the standard.

430
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,840
And if accidents happen,

431
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,520
they keep it quiet, no one takes any responsibility.

432
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,360
Trust me, Joe. Don't do it.

433
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,360
So what would you suggest?

434
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,680
Do I have a choice?

435
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,120
Even if I stay here, it's not different from being dead.

436
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,880
What else can I do?

437
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,360
Joe, what we're trying to say here is...

438
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,400
we are worried about you.

439
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,280
It's alright.

440
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,920
If you don't help me,

441
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,760
I'll find a connection myself.

442
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,600
Joe.

443
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,520
Wut.

444
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,040
If you accept that job,

445
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,560
we aren't bros anymore.

446
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,840
I'll cast a new stuntmen, okay?

447
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,240
Finish the schedule, and we'll have a meeting.

448
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,760
Oh, Mr. Sol, is there anything?

449
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,200
I wanna have a talk with Wut. It won't take long.

450
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,680
Wut is not here.

451
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,920
Oh, Mr. Ming.

452
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,600
Where are you going, Mr. Ming?

453
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,720
Mr. Ming! Mr. Ming!

454
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,080
Move!

455
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,920
Where is Wut?

456
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,320
He really is not here.

457
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,640
What the fuck are you doing?

458
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,040
Where is Joe?

459
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,640
You're the reason why he's gone now.

460
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,680
I too wanna know where he is now.

461
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,120
Well, please take care of it for me.

462
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,920
We work as a family, you know.

463
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,600
Yes.

464
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,880
Just take it easy.

465
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,800
I'll leave it to you.

466
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,800
Of course.

467
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,480
Hello.

468
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,920
Hello, Joe. How's it going?

469
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,800
Our team is an international production.

470
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,520
The director is a foreigner.

471
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,160
But we choose to to shoot in Thailand.

472
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,760
And the crew are all Thais.

473
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,160
Take a look at the view. Isn't it pretty?

474
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,320
It's very pretty.

475
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,080
I've seen that since the first glance.

476
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,000
It's a really big location.
Do you need a permit to shoot here?

477
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,680
Oh, a team of our reputation doesn't need that.

478
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,840
If we want to shoot somewhere, we can just do it.

479
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,920
Really? Won't that be a problem?

480
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,480
Oh, don't worry.

481
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,600
My team, we got a good back up.

482
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,840
ไม่ต้องห่วง

483
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,280
ไหนลองไปคุยกับพวกเขาหน่อย

484
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,720
นี่คุณ...

485
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,480
ทีมสตั๊นท์ที่เรามีอยู่ ไม่ใช่ทีมที่ผมต้องการ

486
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,520
ทำไมเป็นแบบนี้

487
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,480
เดี๋ยวก่อนครับ ใจเย็น ๆ

488
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,320
เราต้องทำตามงบที่เรามีครับ

489
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,800
ทีมสตั๊นท์ที่คุณต้องการแพงเกินไปครับ

490
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,400
เราไม่มีเงินจ่าย

491
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,239
ทีมที่เรามีอยู่นี้ราคาถูกกว่าครับ

492
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,280
แต่ก็สามารถทำงานได้เหมือนกัน

493
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,080
ผมไม่สนเรื่องเงินหรอก คุณก็รู้

494
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,920
ผมต้องการทีมดี ๆ

495
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,199
แต่งบมันสูงครับ

496
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:18,920
คุณเข้าใจผมมั้ย

497
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,639
ไม่เอา!

498
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,400
ผมเข้าใจ แต่ผมไม่เห็นด้วยกับคุณ

499
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,159
ผมต้องการทีมที่ดีสำหรับงานนี้

500
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,000
I'm about to shoot a movie at a cliff out of town.
Don't worry. Sorry for everything.

501
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,160
Hello.

502
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,880
Joe.

503
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,520
Where are you, Joe?

504
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,960
Ming.

505
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,160
Ming, let me go, please.

506
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,280
No!

507
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,200
I want to be with you, Joe.

508
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,840
Ming.

509
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,560
Let's start over.

510
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,560
If you need anything, I can give you everything.

511
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,280
Ming, telling me this now is too late.

512
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,960
No matter how long it takes, I'll be waiting for you.

513
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,920
I'll be waiting here at our home.

514
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,040
I'll cook good food and wait for you to come eat with me.

515
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,920
Joe.

516
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,280
If you come back to me,

517
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,280
I promise you that I won't let you be anybody else's stand-in anymore.

518
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,360
Because I...

519
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,280
Hello.

520
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,120
Hello, Ming.

521
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,360
Hello.

522
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,640
Joe, the set is ready. Let's go.

523
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,800
Alright.

524
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,600
Three.

525
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,880
Two.

526
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,360
One.

527
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,360
Action!

528
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,120
Can you not remember me?

529
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,880
It's me, your Mom.

530
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,920
Your name is Joe, right?

531
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,920
That's such a coincidence.

532
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,720
Wait.

533
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,400
Have we met before?

534
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,400
I think you mistook me for someone else.

535
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,600
Of course, we've met before.

536
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,640
Well, it's because of you.

537
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,440
That's why I'm in this body.

538
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,600
Are you back?

539
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,480
Oh, dear.

540
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,960
Why did you walk in the rain?

541
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,240
Dear, Son, you will get sick.

542
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,120
Come here, get over here, sit down!

543
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,760
C'mon. / It's alright, Mom.

544
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,760
Sit down, my Son.

545
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,480
I think you should go change, or you'll get sick.

546
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,160
Joe.

547
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,600
What's wrong, Joe?

548
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,320
I'm alright.

549
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,560
Joe, it's okay.

550
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,400
I'm right here, it's alright.

551
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,400
You're recovering. You gotta easily adjust yourself.

552
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,440
Don't be too hard on yourself, alright?

553
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,520
Yes, Mom.

554
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,200
If you have anything, you can tell me, alright?

555
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,920
Thank you.

556
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,600
Two years have passed, lots of things change.

557
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,440
Sol went back to Korea.

558
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,920
He only came back to Thailand for work once in a while.

559
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,480
Tong, after I didn't show up at the press conference.

560
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,040
He got to be the male lead in that movie.

561
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,600
Pao was fired.

562
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,040
The movie was sucessful worldwide.

563
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,840
His personal life, he's married May.

564
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,560
And became the wealthy family's in-law.

565
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,240
Ming, who was never interested in entertainment industry.

566
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,320
No one knew, why...in all of a sudden...

567
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,000
in the past six months, he started to star in a movie...and TV ads.

568
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,200
And he became the hottest brand presenter right now.

569
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:48,240
And for me, that international production was silent about my death,
and no know talked about it.

570
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,600
Like I never existed.

571
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,640
My parents passsed away when I was a kid.

572
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,840
I got no relatives.

573
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:01,840
And in no time, others will forget the old Joe.

574
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,320
And my dream was...

575
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,720
seeing lights on when I came home.

576
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,920
And the lovely smell of the food.

577
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,200
And someone...to say,

578
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,120
"You're home?".

579
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,800
Thank you, Ming, for making my dream come true.

580
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:56,440
No matter how long it takes, I'll be waiting for you.

581
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,640
I'll be waiting here at our home.

582
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,280
I'll cook good food and wait for you to come eat with me.

583
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,800
Joe.

584
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,760
If you come back to me,

585
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,040
I promise you that I won't let you be anybody else's stand-in anymore.

586
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,400
Because I...

587
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,920
Because...you...what? What were you trying to say that day?

588
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,200
Joe.

589
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,480
Joe?

590
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,560
Joe!
