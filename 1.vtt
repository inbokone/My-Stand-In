💞 @ kissasian.one

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.240
Hello.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.820
Hello, Joe. How are you?

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.600
I'm Joe, a stand-in.

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.060
My job is act as a stuntman

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.060
to finish

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.160
the dangerous actions dreaded by other actors.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.560
Hello?

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:44.860
Joe,

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.140
Where are you?

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.040
Hello?

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.040
Are you there, Ming?

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.020
Hello?

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.160
Joe, everything's in place.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.080
Time to go.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.860
OK.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.620
Is everything ready?

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.940
It's all set.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.410
The setting is ready. Everyone, keep quiet.
Ready to go!

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.520
And this time, my life will forever

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.620
be changed.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.100
Three.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.520
Two.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.280
One.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.240
Action!

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.220
Help! Help him!

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.000
Hurry up!

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.120
Help! The wire is broken!

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.780
This is my life.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.640
Whenever I'm about to get rid of darkness,

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.520
something will drag me back into the abyss.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.760
But this might be

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.340
my one last attempt to try.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.600
Joe!

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:51.640
Joe!

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.640
Son, you finally woke up!

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.960
Nurse,

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.980
please get the doctor here now.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.060
Joe.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.020
Joe,

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.020
don't leave Mom alone.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.280
Ma'am, who are you?

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.040
Joe,

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.060
can't you remember me?

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.240
I'm your mother.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.700
My mom passed away a long time ago.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.220
Are you mistaken?

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.160
Don't worry.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.600
This patient has just woken up from a two-year coma.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.680
Maybe he can't come to his senses at first.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.640
Now,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.120
you need to give him some time so he can settle in.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.540
I'm conscious.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.680
You must have made a mistake.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.300
We'll check on you again when we have time.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.980
Now you need to rest. Got it?

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.220
Later on, ma'am, please bring your son's file to my office.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.560
Oh, OK.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.260
Joe,

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.000
I will be right back.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.400
They're not mistaken.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.020
The fact is

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.340
that my soul seems to have entered someone's body.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.720
All the indicators are showing improvement.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.919
The doctor said he would gradually recover his memories.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.520
I'm already grateful to see him wake up.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:40.559
Yeah, me too.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.919
Thank you.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.750
You'll be discharged from the hospital soon.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.600
About the timetable of taking medicine...

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.080
Well, just follow the doctor's instructions.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.440
-OK.
-Just take the medicine as normal.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.500
Unfortunately,

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.280
this woman's son is gone.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.040
His name seems to be the same as mine.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.320
Maybe the Grim Reaper dragged off the wrong person.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:04.980
Wait.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.280
Could it be possible that this woman's son and I have switched bodies?

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.560
Hey!

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.040
Ing, has he really woken up?

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.060
When the nurse told me that,

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.180
I thought she was joking.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.440
Yeah. He did wake up.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.720
You're so lame.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:37.760
Don't put the bottle down. Don't stop drinking.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.890
Don't drop the bottle. Keep drinking.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.700
This is Wut.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.380
The man in bed is his father who is receiving treatment now.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.080
Is your name Joe?

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.240
What a coincidence!

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.160
I used to have a younger friend named Joe too.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:55.900
I guess

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.340
he's a bit older than you.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.140
But don't worry.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.370
You're much better-looking than him.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.560
How is he doing now?

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.680
An accident happened.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.380
Joe

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.220
fell off a cliff and has been missing for two years.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.970
His body hasn't been found yet.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.540
You're much luckier than him,

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.160
because you're awake now.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.700
Ing,

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.140
how much longer will Joe stay here?

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.560
The doctor said he'd check on Joe again soon.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.880
1 month later

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.660
Hi, Ing!

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.360
Are you going home now?

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:42.900
Yes.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Let me give you a ride.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.800
No need. We'd hate to bother you.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.680
Ing, just let me do you a favor.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.600
It's me who's been bothering you.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.520
You've helped me take care of my father for a long time.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.180
Let me drive you home. My car's parked out there.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.180
Don't overthink it.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.940
What's wrong, son?

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.030
Does that face ring a bell with you?

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.060
Ing, it's impossible.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.720
Joe has been a model for years.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.960
But that boy

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.640
didn't start his modelling career

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.840
until six months ago.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.290
So there's no way they two have met before.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.220
Oh, right.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.200
Wut, you're in the entertainment business too.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.460
Do you know this boy?

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.100
Yes.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.910
I'm very familiar with him.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:40.760
Let's go.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:41.880
OK.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.660
Ing, hold my arm, or you might fall.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:45.780
-Walk slowly.
-Thanks.

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.000
I'm gonna hold your arm.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.460
Come on in.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.220
Thank you.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.960
Keep up, son.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.000
Sorry.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.460
Mind your steps.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.380
OK.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.000
Please come in.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.000
Thank you.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.100
I'm gonna put your luggage here, Ing.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.400
Thank you.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:37.420
Let's have dinner together.
Thank you.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.600
Let's eat together.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.180
I'll heat the food right now. It'll just take a second.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.740
Thank you so much, Ing.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.060
But I need to attend a meeting soon.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:45.080
Let's go together next time.
But I have a meeting later.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.610
Let's meet again sometime.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:47.880
Oh, what a shame!

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.820
No worries. We'll eat together next time.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:50.540
Alright?

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.280
I'm going to heat the food now.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.360
Sure, Mom.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.600
Joe!

00:12:59.040 --> 00:12:59.980
Yes?

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.980
Let's talk about jobs.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.960
I have my own entertainment company.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.280
After you make a full recovery,

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.820
if there is a job you want to do,

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:09.880
just give me a call.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.080
Thank you, Wut.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.380
I don't know why,

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.180
but you always remind me of my friend Joe.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.220
Never mind.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.220
I'm leaving.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.180
Bye.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.220
OK.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.100
A living man fell off a cliff.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:20.620
Why wouldn't anyone talk about him?

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.800
Here's hot porridge for you.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:40.660
Thanks.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.000
Well...

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.120
Mom, aren't you going to take a rest?

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.520
I'm good.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.280
Joe, you've just got better.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.260
You need rest more than I do.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.820
I've made you some hot porridge.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.380
Let me feed you, son.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.180
Don't gulp it down.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.920
Maybe it's a bit too hot.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.310
Does it taste good, son?

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.940
Why not let me eat it myself?

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:19.980
OK.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Joe.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.160
I...

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.520
I don't want you to start working so soon.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.860
I'd like you to heal first.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.660
Mom,

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:48.940
you've spent a lot of your savings on me in these two years, right?

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:52.980
In the past,

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.820
we lived in a better house than this.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.900
Though I retired,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.930
I managed to build up some savings.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.100
I thought if they could bring you back,

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.320
it'd be worthwhile to spend them on you.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.120
That'd be my greatest pleasure.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:18.340
Thank you, Mom.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.400
You saved my life.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.580
From now on, let me take care of you.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:28.860
Good boy.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:30.960
Come here.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.110
My dearest child.

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:46.200
Fine.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.390
From now on, I'll be this woman's son's stand in.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.800
My company isn't very big,

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.920
but it covers a comprehensive range of business,

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.000
including photography, production and post-production,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:09.940
you name it.

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:11.300
The best part is,

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:13.210
we have our own stand-in actors,

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:16.540
since the primary business here is shooting action movies.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.550
It may not look convincing to you, but the truth is,

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:20.750
I am

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:23.180
also an experienced stand-in.

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:25.640
Let's go.

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:27.380
Hello.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.140
Hello, Wut.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:32.920
Hello.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:34.810
Whoa. All of you are working hard.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:35.970
Oh. You look so pretty today.

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:36.570
Thank you.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.400
Joe, keep up.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:45.450
Have a seat.

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:01.880
Oh.

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.630
Do you remember

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:04.770
the boy I've mentioned to you, who's also named Joe?

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.370
He used to be a stand-in here.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.900
He was the most professional actor in the company's history,

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.690
and was especially selected to be a stuntman for Tong.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:16.950
Do you know who Tong is?

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.810
I sure do.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:21.810
Tong

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.650
is an amazing action star.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.130
Well, Wut,

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:32.330
is there a job I can take behind the scenes?

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.340
I'll be happy with a job in the property group or on the lighting crew.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.100
Hold on.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:38.900
Ing has told me

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.530
that you want to be a celebrity, don't you?

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:42.330
Well,

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.940
now I'm thinking maybe a job behind the scenes is more stable.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.070
So I'd like to give it a try if possible.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:51.610
Suit yourself.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.760
The property group happens to be recruiting.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.220
I'll take you there later.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.280
-Thank you.
-You’re welcome.

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:02.200
Wut, Pipan is looking for you.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.050
Pipan?

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:04.350
Oh no.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.400
I've forgotten a board meeting.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.560
Yim,

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.460
take this young man to the property group,

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.970
and tell Jo that this is my decision.

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:11.630
OK.

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:13.560
He's all yours.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.950
The shooting starts tomorrow, but now things aren't ready yet.

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:25.610
Are we gonna stay up all night?

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.320
-Don't forget to the check the cables.
-Jo.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.880
Wut has arranged for a young man to work here.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.140
Great. We happen to be in need of a helper.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.790
Young man, what's your name?

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:35.000
I'm Joe.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.920
Another man whose name sounds the same as mine.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.250
There used to be a stand-in called Joe too.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.530
So I had to change my name to Jojo.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:44.580
Listen,

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.820
have you taken a similar job before?

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.250
I used to be a model.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.830
My goodness!

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.840
Does Wut mean for this as a prank?

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.070
Is my group now the art department?

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:56.700
Is this supposed to be fun?

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.360
Why would he send a model here?

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.180
I can't believe he would do this.

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:02.080
Whatever. Let's see what you're capable of.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.820
Then we'll decide if you can stay.

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.550
Two pistols.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.430
One long-barreled gun.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.250
Two pocket knives,

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.290
and a set of ropes.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.740
All the 18 items are here, sir.

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:29.070
Is it true

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.210
that you've never had a job behind the scenes?

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.740
Oh. I've done some work for my friends before.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:37.410
You're good.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.300
So much for today.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:40.900
It's time to eat.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.090
-OK.
-I'm starving.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.300
My wife's cooking will cheer you up at work.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.330
Wow, Jo.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.850
I miss the noodles made by your wife so much.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.560
Have you tried some before?

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.220
Aren't you new to the company?

00:20:58.980 --> 00:20:59.770
Oh.

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:02.520
I've never tasted the noodles. I've just heard

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.180
that your wife is a great cook.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:06.860
Jojo,

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.420
bad news.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.440
I don't think we can go home today.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:11.500
What the heck?

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.640
I'm talking about Ming's commercial.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.410
He's moving the shooting up to today.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:16.780
Wut is very angry.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.460
Today?

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:20.620
Really?

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:23.290
I'm a big fan of Ming's!

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.370
I need to put on some make-up!

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:26.200
Hey!

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:27.990
What is it with you?

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:29.210
You look pale.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.620
You were fine just now.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.630
I'm suddenly feeling a bit light-headed.

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:36.040
Can I go home for a rest today, Jo?

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.490
I know you're recovering from trauma.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:40.550
Go home and rest.
Leave the work to us.

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:41.980
I'm so sorry.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.780
I'll make it up by working extra hours next time.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.310
It's okay. Go get some rest.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:48.520
Sorry.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:22.160
Hold on.

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.850
It's like the feeling I had three years ago

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:34.170
has come back to me now.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.520
Tong!

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.140
Have we met before?

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.460
You must have mistaken me for someone else.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.920
3 years ago

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.280
Joe,

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:23.520
stop eating,

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.180
or you're gonna do your make-up on your own.

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.920
You're so slow at this. I'm famished.

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.900
Your face is different from Tong's,

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.720
so the make-up process would take some time.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.500
You're really annoying.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.330
It's done.

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:43.480
Thank you.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.340
Except for your face, you do look like Tong,

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:52.210
especially from behind.

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:55.560
You're exaggerating, Yim.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.890
There can't be such a strong resemblance.

00:24:58.820 --> 00:24:59.800
Tong!

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:16.410
Who are you?

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.300
I'm Tong's stand-in.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.620
Then where is Tong?

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:23.990
I guess he hasn't arrived yet.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.730
Is there anything urgent?

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:28.970
No.

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:39.660
Who's that?

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:40.970
I don't know.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:42.710
Maybe he's a fan of Tong's.

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:44.890
Really?

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:46.110
What's that about?

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:57.230
Alright. Everyone, get ready. Turn the electric fan off, please.

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:00.220
Actors, to your places. Everyone, keep quiet.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.320
Action!

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.540
Cut! Pass!

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:51.130
Smile more.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.770
How's it going now? Say it.

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:56.340
Just a sec, bro.

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:00.130
Actually, we've finished nearly all the scenes,

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.160
except for the parts involving Tong.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.880
When will Tong arrive?

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:10.020
I usually book his time slots in advance, but he's always busy.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.220
Hello, everyone!

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.420
Hello.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.660
I'm sorry for being late.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.680
I was held up by some fans who brought me packed meals.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.690
Help yourself,

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:22.610
if you haven't had enough lunch.

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:25.350
Outside there are two food truck sent by my fans.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.080
-Hello.
-Hello, Tong.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:29.780
Hi, Director Pao.

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:32.540
How are you? Have you lost weight?

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:33.760
Yeah.

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:35.760
I don't feel like eating lately.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.820
Are you stressed out? What happened?

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:42.250
I'm anxious about the filming.
The schedule doesn't agree with me quite well.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.880
Oh.

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:45.850
Alright. I wish you all the best.

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:47.800
OK. Go get changed now.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.540
Joe, how are you?

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.380
How many takes have you done?

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:57.340
We've just finished filming the first scene.

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.690
Only the first scene?

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.720
It means we'll have to wait for the next scene to be set up, right?

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.650
I would've come half an hour later if I had known that.

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.040
Thank you so much.

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.690
OK. Hello, guys!

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:16.120
Hi, Yo.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:17.760
How have you been?

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:19.810
Have you lost weight or what?

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:21.220
Tong, nothing's changed about me.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.690
My name is still Yim.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.320
Yim?

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:25.720
I'm sorry.

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:27.000
I'm getting old.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.450
Please don't take offense to that.

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:30.050
Who says you're getting old?

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:32.070
You're as handsome as ever.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:33.900
Ming?

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.320
When did you come back?

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:38.930
I just got off the plane this morning.

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:40.190
Tong, I've graduated.

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:42.360
I'm thinking about getting a job here.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.560
I thought you were gonna stay there for a much longer time.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.760
If that's really a lovely place,

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.320
you would've paid a visit to me there.

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.980
You know I've been busy working, don't you?

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:58.560
But I did ask May to bring you gifts.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.880
That doesn't count.

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:02.930
How about this?

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:06.650
You'll treat me to dinner tonight, and we'll call it even.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.610
Oh, Ming. Today...

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.620
My whole day will be taken up by the filming.

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.810
I'm afraid I won't be off work until it's pitch dark.

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:16.820
Shall we

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.280
go to dinner next time?

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.090
Tong,

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.790
my only purpose here is to meet you.

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:28.820
-Uh...
-Dong, I'm going to put lipstick on you.

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:30.060
Sure. Sure.

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:31.960
I have to go on with my make-up.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:32.960
Talk to you later.

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:36.810
OK.

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.800
Where are you going? I can give you a lift.

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:11.780
Don't bother.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.290
Get in the car.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:20.520
It's going to rain. This is not exactly a good time to get a cab.

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.440
I'm going to a friend's place.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.580
Just drop me at a light rail station.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:32.450
Get in.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:17.930
Every muscle of mine is sore and aching.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.220
There could be a traffic jam at this hour.

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:24.880
Yeah.

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:31.450
My name is Joe.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.280
Are you a fan of Tong's?

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:52.960
Yes.

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:02.740
Frankly, I thought you were a celebrity at first.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.230
You're very good-looking.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.980
Or are you really a celebrity?

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:09.080
Are you?

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:10.170
No.

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:12.800
Oh, you're not.

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:17.940
Care for some music?

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:22.360
Hello. Where are you?

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:23.860
In a cab?

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:26.250
Yes.

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.820
I'm going to May's.

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.210
Stop by my place first.

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:33.210
I'm throwing a party for you, international student.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.860
Didn't you say you had long working hours today?

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:37.990
Were you fooling me?

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.000
Oh.

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:42.610
You gave me a surprise. Why couldn't I give you one?

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:43.880
Thank God

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.290
May has already talked to the house owner.

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:49.240
She started planning a party for you in the morning.

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.480
Look.

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:51.960
Surprise!

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:54.420
Come to us!

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:55.610
Look at this!

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:58.170
I've prepared your favorite braised meat!

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.440
I've changed my mind.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.940
You can take me wherever you want.

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:10.640
Ah?

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.600
Where do you wanna go?

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:14.620
As I said, anywhere is fine.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:19.900
In that case,

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.850
I guess I can turn right and stop at a restaurant.

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.280
If you really can't think of a place to go,

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.520
you can drive me to your home.

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:22.409
My home's on the top floor of this building.

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:24.270
Are you sure you wanna go up there?

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:26.530
Why would you ask?

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.800
Don't you wanna get laid with me?

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:03.740
Be careful.
It's very dark here.

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.650
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:57.380
Do you have a condom?

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.860
Let me have it.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.540
You like being on the top too?

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:38.450
I'll go back first.
Wait.

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:41.670
Just wait till the rain stops.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.640
It's still raining outside.

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:48.420
Are you sure this is a good idea?

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:20.360
Hmm.

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:24.020
I don't know if it'll be enough.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.700
This is all I could find in the fridge.

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.500
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.630
Oh. Wait a second.

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:32.650
Just a moment.

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:36.660
OK.

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:41.250
This is my secret recipe.

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.980
Slow down,

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:03.970
or you might choke.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:06.920
It's delicious.

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.380
I guess it's because you're hungry.

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:17.590
Aren't you gonna eat some?

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:18.860
No, I'm good.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.360
Seeing how much you enjoy it, I'm already full.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.050
You're blessed with a glib tongue.

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:25.460
You always have company for dinner, don't you?

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:26.650
I wish.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.860
I've been eating alone for years.

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:32.930
Then why would you have a condom?

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.920
Just in case.

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.680
I was gonna use it,

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:39.940
but you tried to fight me off for it.

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:48.130
Slow down.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.560
Here's water for you.

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:54.880
Eat some more.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.840
You've made your way here after all.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.700
Though there's no sex, at least you won't leave with an empty stomach.

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:08.180
-Joe.
-Hmm?

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.340
Can I spend the night here?

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:41.640
Can you sleep?

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.640
My pillows aren't very soft.

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:46.640
What about you?

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:49.880
You can switch places with me.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.130
No need.

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:53.660
You should sleep in bed.

00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:58.370
Obviously, you've never slept on the floor before, have you?

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:00.920
No.

00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:13.420
Sleep in bed with me.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.340
No. The bed's yours. I'm all good.

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:18.860
Just come here.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.250
Or do you want me to sleep on the floor with you?

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:47.580
Seriously, you haven't told me your name yet.

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:51.530
It's Ming.

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:55.010
Well,

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:58.130
will you still be here when I wake up tomorrow?

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:02.400
I'm usually not very mean to my friends with benefits.

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:07.380
But we aren't that kind of friends.

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:10.460
No, we aren't.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:16.010
Actually, I don't care much about being on the top or bottom.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.170
However,

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:19.980
I've never really had a try.

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:26.600
Is it fair to say

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:30.050
that I could've been your first man?

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:36.730
Yeah.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.860
You're saving your precious first experience for someone you'd like to treat seriously.

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.120
Please don't waste it on a person like me.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:02.960
Well,

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.290
isn't there someone you'd like to give your heart to?

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:08.160
Hmm.

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.200
But as far as I can tell,

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.720
you must have many suitors.

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:23.840
I'm sleepy.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:25.730
I'm gonna sleep now.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:27.640
If it weren't for Ming's perfume still lingering around,

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.900
I would probably think what happened

00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:40.480
was just a dream.

00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:46.620
Just put it there, ma'am.

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:48.940
I'd like to take a rest.

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.760
You should get some rest too.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.620
OK. If you need anything, just let me know.

00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:14.580
I said I wanted to take a rest.

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:19.840
Tong.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.900
You're finally back, rascal.

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:26.380
Last night,

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:27.770
where did you go?

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:30.480
May was very worried sick. You know that?

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:32.490
Oh.

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:34.860
I was with an old friend last night.

00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:37.250
I hadn't seen him for a long time.

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.780
I got really drunk.

00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:44.280
So your friend's more important than me, right?

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.040
I'm sorry.

00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:49.360
Tonight,

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.970
May's going out to work.

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:53.120
I'll finish today's filming,

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.520
and then meet up with you.

00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:57.320
Don't bail on me this time.

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:00.850
I won't.

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.610
Here you are.

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:11.810
Thanks, Jo.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.020
Take the eggplant too.

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:14.890
OK.

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:17.520
I was kidding. You can only have one chicken foot.

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:18.660
Thank you.

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:21.460
-You want a bigger portion?
-Yes.

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:22.620
Alright.

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:24.450
One more piece for you.

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:25.100
OK.

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:29.680
What's wrong, Joe?

00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:33.140
My wife made these noodles.

00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:35.890
It took her all night!

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:38.090
They smell really good. Why aren't you eating?

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:39.620
Come get some more before they're gone.

00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:40.680
Enjoy the food, Jo.

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:44.020
Thank you for the invite but I'm just not that hungry today.

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:45.980
You seem upset.

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:47.720
Having trouble in your love life?

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:48.920
Who's the lucky girl?

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:52.770
That cute and sweet lady we all know?

00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:56.990
Oh. Jo, you don't know much about Joe's preferences, do you?

00:47:57.130 --> 00:47:58.240
What?

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.620
What kind of girls do you like?

00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:18.050
In the blink of an eye, four year passed.

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:22.660
I still remember the day when we dropped you at the airport.

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:23.900
At that time,

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:27.760
May cried so hard as if you were going onto the battlefield.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:31.300
What about you? How have you been?

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:32.420
Me?

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:33.770
Well...

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:34.890
I'm doing great.

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:37.330
Same old, same old.

00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:40.640
There are too many uncertainties in this line of business.

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:41.900
Perhaps

00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:43.420
I'll do a different job.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.160
I'm talking about

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:48.970
you and May.

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:52.730
Me and her?

00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:56.160
Things are great.

00:48:57.690 --> 00:49:00.530
I'm helping her with her cake shop.

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:02.570
Do you know

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:03.760
that May

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.120
is leading a hectic life?

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:06.960
Now,

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:10.050
I'm just one step away from moving into her apartment.

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:11.570
Sounds good.

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:13.780
She has you to share her burden with.

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:15.690
How about you?

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:19.540
I...

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:25.640
Speak of the devil.

00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:27.600
May's calling me.

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:29.850
Hello?

00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:32.700
I'm having dinner with Ming now.

00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:36.120
I'm not feeling well.

00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:39.700
Really? Have you taken medicine yet?

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:43.020
Yes, but it doesn't seem to help.

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.800
Call me again if you can't feel better.

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:47.300
OK. OK.

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:48.920
Alright.

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:54.970
May said on the phone

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:57.040
that she was having a headache,

00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.600
and wondering

00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:00.610
when I would return.

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.240
You should go now, Tong.

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:06.880
I'm already full.

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.090
Are you sure?

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:11.810
Just go and take care of May.

00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:13.890
It's OK. I'll go home myself.

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:17.890
Well,

00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:19.330
next time,

00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:21.350
I'll treat you to dinner again.

00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:24.060
We can invite May as well.

00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:26.480
Will that be OK?

00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:28.080
Sure.

00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.640
See you.

00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:22.250
Uh, I'm done here.

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:23.730
Sir, here's the outfit.

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:24.570
Just a sec.

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:25.530
Thank you.

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:26.380
Take care.

00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:27.300
OK.

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:33.140
Hello?

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:34.810
Are you Joe?

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:36.330
Yes.

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:37.530
Who is it?

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:40.290
I'm Ming. Are you busy?

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:56.810
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:01.090
How did you get my phone number?

00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:02.770
I'm not telling you.

00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:05.880
Ming,

00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:08.840
are you drunk?

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.130
No.

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:13.730
Order whatever you want.

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:18.370
Oh, I can't finish what's on the table.

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.410
By the way,

00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:23.800
this room isn't exactly big, is it, Ming?

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:26.050
I thought it'd be huge.

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.540
You're such a chatterbox.

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:29.630
Just order more food as I told you.

00:52:58.080 --> 00:52:59.120
I thought

00:52:59.530 --> 00:53:00.920
you had forgotten me.

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:11.060
What about you? Do you remember me?

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.180
What do you think?

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:23.250
It seems like

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.980
you can't get me out of your head, can you?

00:53:35.050 --> 00:53:36.200
What can I get you?

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:38.570
Uh...

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:40.960
Would you give me a moment?

00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:44.510
I've never been to this place before. I don't know what to order.

00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:53.700
Don't be nervous.

00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:57.690
What are you looking at?

00:53:57.810 --> 00:53:58.870
Get us some drinks.

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:22.160
Have you picked out what you want?

00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:29.080
Slowly.

00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:29.940
Hmm.

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:32.320
Be careful, Ming.

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:38.780
Humph!

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.100
And you keep denying being drunk.

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.200
I'm not drunk.

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:45.970
Oh!

00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:05.900
Where are you going?

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:09.430
I'm gonna take a shower.

00:55:40.450 --> 00:55:43.110
So your friend's more important than me, right?

00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:44.120
I'm sorry.

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:47.340
I'll get going then.

00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:27.530
Ming?

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:34.370
Ming?

00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:40.380
I know.

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.880
Why must you be a virgin?

00:56:54.850 --> 00:56:56.360
I wouldn't mind giving you

00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:58.610
my virginity.

00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:53.330
Back then, I felt like I was in a dream.

00:58:55.930 --> 00:58:58.260
I just didn't know it was a nightmare,

00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:04.240
and that the person before my eyes would destroy my life.
