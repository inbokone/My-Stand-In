WEBVTT

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.670
You're up?

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.920
Wanna eat anything?

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.000
I'm about to order some food.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.550
Did you take me here last night?

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.280
Yeah.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.920
I tried to ask where your place was.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.590
But you were really drunk.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.590
Last night, did we...

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.110
Yeah.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.480
But it's alright. I'm okay.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.550
I'm sorry.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.710
Why would you say that? I told you I'm okay.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.840
How about you, Ming? Are you alright?

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.920
Yes, I am.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.670
But I can't really remember anything about last night.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.280
Just remembered that...

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.920
someone sneezed when he reached orgasm.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.440
Are you crazy?

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.840
Who would sneeze when having orgasm?

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.360
The weather is nice.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.400
One more time?

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.070
Ming.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.030
Ming, no! I got no energy left.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.030
Ming...

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.550
Shit!

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.510
I got a morning queue.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.960
Gotta go now.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.440
I'm sorry, Ming.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.440
Find something from the fridge to eat.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.110
I think I'll go home.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.480
It's alright.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.230
I put my key under the tree pot in front of the house.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.230
When you're done, just put it back.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.840
Joe.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.070
Huh?

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.590
Will Tong be at the set?

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.590
Yeah.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.150
Why?

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.190
Can I tag along?

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.440
Sure.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.920
I'm half an hour late.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.190
Pao must scold me for sure.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.880
Joe.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.000
Huh?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.630
You must not tell anyone about last night.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.280
I know.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.840
Even if I told anyone, no one would believe me anyway.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.840
I'm serious.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.920
Alright. I won't tell anyone.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.230
What happened, Joy?

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.360
What's wrong with Tong?

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.630
Er..

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.360
Tong isn't being bossy...

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.280
It's just that he's a bit sick.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.630
Sick? What do you mean, Joy?

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.110
He was gliding along the set this morning.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.760
That was the spirit of the actor.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.710
- He might want to work quickly.
- Yim, what the heck happened?

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.550
Well, the drowning female character resuce scene,...

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.190
Tong doesn't wanna play.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.030
So he wants you to play for him instead.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.230
Me?

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.070
Me? How to? There are lines to be said.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.150
They won't shoot your face.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.030
And they will cut it to the scene where they talk at the infirmary.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.710
I know we have stand-in.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.480
But he's for the risky scenes.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.590
The viewers must see Tong's face in this scene.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.000
Joy, you understand it, right? It...

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.630
Tong, Tong, do you understand me?

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.960
This is the first scene that he saves her life for the first time.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.920
So, no matter what, I want your face to be seen.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.960
Alright.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.670
I'll play it.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.480
But if my condition gets worst,

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.550
I may have to rest

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.360
around one or two weeks.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.800
Don't mind that.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.590
Alright, then.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.030
Joe.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:29.440
Yes?

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.440
Go change.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.030
And play for Tong instead.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.360
Calm down, I'll manage it for you.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.840
Hurry up.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.840
Well, be calm.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.630
Hey, go, go change.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.880
Poy, go brief him.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.880
Right away.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.070
Everyone, listen.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.630
The next scene we're gonna play,

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.840
Marasri will grab the female lead's head at the pool.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.070
And she will push her into the pool.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.920
The female lead can't swim...

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.150
but we got our male lead played by Joe.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.280
He's going to jump into the pool and help her up.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.840
Let's do it. Hurry up!

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.840
It's 10:30 a.m., and we still haven't filmed the swimming pool scene.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:09.880
Hello.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.670
Oh, hello. Hello, Lyla. Hi.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.590
Today I need you to work a bit.

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.190
You have to fall into the pool.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.590
This morning, we had a staff check it out.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:17.920
He went down the pool, it's not deep.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.030
I feel sorry for her.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.550
It's her first movie and the male lead leave her to play by herself.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.150
That's true.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.920
Look at her face.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.400
I think she's really disappointed.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.480
I heard that she's a big fan of Tong too.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.760
And look at how nervous she is.
I don't think it's gonna be fast.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.710
Maybe Pao will tell her to be pushed into the pool all day.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.880
I'm with you. I feel sorry for her.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.400
Lyla, you wait here.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.960
- Alright. And May, come with me to see the blocking.
- Alright.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:46.670
- Hey, Joe.
- Yes.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.150
Let's go.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.190
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.110
Hi, my name is Joe.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.110
I'll be playing the pool scene instead of Tong.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.280
Oh, right.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.800
And where has Tong gone?

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.280
Tong is a little unwell.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.150
So he will be supporting you right in front of the monitor.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.480
But it's really alright. He sent me here instead.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.800
So you won't be so nervous.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.960
Please help me. I can't really swim.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.630
You got it, no worries.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.350
I've been through all this before.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.470
Jumping into pools, doing stunts.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.470
And when I was little, I liked to play a mermaid with my friends.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.840
Just imagine that you're about to swim

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.840
and save the prince's life?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.720
Okay.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.920
- Okay?
- Yes, of course.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.000
Alright, silence. Ready?

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.470
Everyone, ready? We only got one shot.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:40.760
Alright. Camera.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.190
And action!

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.640
How dare you messing with my Dang?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.070
I...never...

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.310
I guess we can't do the talking.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.680
Don't say that I'm cruel.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:59.430
Get over here!

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.640
In case the water in the pool can cleanse your dirtiness.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:07.430
Help!

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Walapa!

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.190
Cut!

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.800
Great!

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.840
That was awesome.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.470
Thank you.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:46.470
No, thank you.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.350
Hey, take care of the cast.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.920
I'll carry you.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.230
Thank you.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:01.230
That was really good.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.430
- If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be able to do it.
- No, that's not it, you did great by yourself.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.520
Are you cold? One sec. They'll bring you a towel.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:20.350
Well, how was it?

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:21.350
Good. Let's go. Change.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.640
I just knew that being a stand-in...aside from playing the risky scenes...

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
you gotta play him instead?

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:41.070
I guess.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.880
I feel sorry for the girl.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.390
It's her first movie.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.390
But she was left to drown by the male lead.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.760
- Tong.
- Huh?

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:55.350
Let's sit here.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.840
About last night, I'm sorry.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:06.880
It's alright.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:09.150
If you're really okay, then that's good.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:14.230
Here. The bakery from this cafe is really good.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.560
I'm full.

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:23.230
Then, can I feed you?

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.230
Of course.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.600
- The green one?
- Sure.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.880
It's as good as before.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:42.520
One more bite?

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.110
- Absolutely. Here.
- C'mon.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.150
What is it? Why did you call me here?

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.310
Are you bisexual?

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.920
Huh?

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.110
Or do you always take care of every female lead like this?

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.030
Oh,

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:28.720
I like guys.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:32.230
So when I'm around girls, I don't think of anything.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.640
That's why you're close to the make-up artist like that?

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:38.230
Yim?

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.880
I was the one who asked him to work here.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.390
We both went to the same school.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.560
What's wrong with you, Ming? Are you mad at me?

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.760
Who's mad at you?

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:51.190
I was just asking.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.190
Then, can I ask you, Ming?

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.640
Ming seems to be close to Tong.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Do you like him?

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.470
Don't you ever say that again.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.310
Tong is my sister's boyfriend.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.760
Oh?

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.600
Then, I'm sorry.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:19.110
Well, I didn't know that Tong got a girlfriend.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.960
He said not to tell anyone.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:24.680
He doesn't want other people to get involved.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.070
Oh.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.600
I get that. He's a superstar.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:33.190
But I think your sister's awesome.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:35.760
She's got the country's sweetheart as her own.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.560
You don't think I know that?

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.560
What's wrong with you, Ming?

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.520
I'm sorry. I was just being happy for them.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.880
And what do you want to have for dinner?

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.800
Hot pot? I'll make that for you.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.800
It's alright.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.070
I'll go eat at my place.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:29.310
Thank you so much...

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.800
for being with me until the work's done for the day.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:33.390
You're welcome.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.070
Are you sure that you're not gonna go eat with me first?

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.030
Maybe next time.

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:44.030
I happened to have a plan with May.

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:51.430
Alright.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.640
Go home safely.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.800
Thanks.

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:34.150
Oh, Ming.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.470
Why didn't you tell me before coming home?

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:37.920
Have you eaten anything?

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:41.600
I'm not very hungry.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.520
Are you free tomorrow?

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.230
Auntie Mol wants to see you.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.600
I'll go shower now.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.640
C'mon!

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.430
Remember, the main job for stuntmen is taking care of your body.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.600
If this is unbearable,

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:10.030
the real work is much harder.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:11.030
Come on!

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:15.960
What's wrong with Joe today? He's so uptight.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.230
Why are you guys talking? Huh?

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:20.840
More push-ups! Now!

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.840
Yes!

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.560
I haven't seen you in so long, Linin. You look more beautiful, darling.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.030
Thank you, Auntie.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.600
You have good manners.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:40.920
She's a shy one. She always go everywhere with her mother.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.720
How about your son? How is he doing?

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.720
He's working hard.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.190
Oh, say hello to Auntie Mol, darling.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.560
Can you remember Linin?

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:57.190
No.

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:02.960
Eh, where did they see each other?

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.069
At Tum's wedding in Kao Yai.

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:06.800
Yeah, that's right, that's right!

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.800
Can you remember Ming?

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.839
A little bit, Auntie.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.560
You're so sweet. You can remember him.

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:20.880
Ming, go change, hurry up. We'll have a meal together.

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:22.880
Don't let her wait too long.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.150
No need. You don't have to rush him.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.720
Are we alright?

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.070
No!

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:32.190
Are we alright?

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:33.190
No!

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:42.150
We're training so hard. When can we find a girlfriend?

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.030
If you got one, you would be scolded like me all the time.

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:48.230
Because I got no time for her.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:49.520
What are you talking?

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:50.960
Oh, it's nothing.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.680
Hey, you got a girl?

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:57.310
Yes.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.390
So...how did you start?

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.640
I sent her funny texts and said hello to her frequently.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.600
You were like teenagers.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.110
But...why are you asking, Joe?

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.110
I have a friend who's a writer, so he had me go ask around.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.000
Wait, who told you to stop?

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Continue!

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.600
Push-ups!

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.470
All the way up and all the way down.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.520
So you ran away from the political match to smoke out here?

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:00.190
But you seem like you're used to it already.

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:04.430
Well,

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.350
you're the third one this week,

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.230
whom my Mom made an appointment.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.760
How about you? How many have you met this week?

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.720
You're the first one,

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.470
but this won't end easily.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.760
That's normal.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.000
Why is she so afraid of me having no husband?

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:20.960
These days,

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.390
if you got money, you could buy anything, right?

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.520
My main job is a stand-in but if you wanna get some, I'm a stand-by.

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:42.350
Was that your girlfriend?

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.680
No.

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:48.430
Don't think I don't know.

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:55.520
- C'mon, guys, dessert is here.
- Yes, Mom.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.760
How about this?

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.520
You hurry and go see your girl.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.760
And then I'll tell my Mom that you gotta go do something.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:04.880
So we'll be free.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.680
Deal?

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:29.110
When you're at the brink of life and death,

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.390
focus is the most important thing.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:32.390
Because if you lose it only for one second...

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:42.880
Ming!

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.680
Guys, take a break, now.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.920
Drink some water. Go!

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.190
What are you doing here?

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.030
Well, I'm kinda free so I came over to see you.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.640
Are you busy?

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.640
Oh, not at all.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.470
I just had the guys take a break...

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.270
so they could have some water.

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:08.430
And have you eaten? Are you hungry?

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.390
Is there a restroom here?

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.600
Yeah.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.600
Then, take me there.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.600
Well, sorry, Ming. The restroom is kinda far away.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.230
That's good,

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.030
so no one can hear us.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.920
Ming.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.350
What are you doing?

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:38.760
Hush.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.960
Ming.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.520
I still gotta teach.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.680
Then stop me.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.840
Our work is to not be afraid!

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:08.470
Hurry up!

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.960
No matter what, you gotta be able to take the pressure.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.640
All the way up, all the way down. Now!

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:24.640
Patience!

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:35.760
You can't do it? Come on! Fast!

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.840
Don't whine. No matter how much it hurts,

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.840
You gotta persevere.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.600
Ming.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.840
Ming.

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:54.030
Ming, Ming, Ming, easy.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:55.190
Ming, I can't hold it anymore.

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.190
Ming, Ming, Ming.

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:12.230
Ming, you like doing it from behind?

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:17.070
I see you only do this position.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.190
And you don't like it?

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.230
Ming, that's enough. I'm tired.

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:32.230
Ming.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.520
Then stop me.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.840
Joe.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:45.960
Huh?

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:46.960
Can I borrow this?

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.640
Sure.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.030
Wow,

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.070
why can't I look that good in that shirt?

00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.760
What are you doing?

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:01.350
Breakfast.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.600
How would you like your fried egg?

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:08.390
Sunny side up.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.800
Okay.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.920
Do you want coffee?

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.150
Oh, that's alright. I'll make it. Leave it there.

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:16.350
It's alright.

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:19.430
2 sugars?

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.680
What are you staring at?

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:37.270
I'm just not used to it.

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:39.270
Normally, I live alone.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.760
Ming, I don't have to work today.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.760
Do you want me to give you a ride home?

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.150
It's alright. It's a mess in my family now.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.840
Can I hide here for a few days?

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:57.350
Of course.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:00.070
Or you can move in and stay with me for a long long time if you want to.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.070
Just kidding.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.680
Here.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.680
Are you alright?

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.070
C'mon, give me one more time.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:26.560
Easy, there. Okay, that's very good. And gently down.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.230
Are you tired? Ah, you're doing good.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.190
Are you tired? How are you doing?

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.150
Here. Grab my hand. Easy.

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:36.110
- Alright, are you tired?
- Yes, I am.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:36.960
Okay.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.310
Oh, are you alright?

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.350
Easy, easy there. Okay.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.960
How are you doing? Keep going.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.960
Okay.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.190
Why is Joe being so kind today?

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:52.150
That's true.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:53.470
- Joe.
- Huh?

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.430
Is it true that there's a stunt from our team...

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.520
went to an audition to become an idol in Korea?

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.390
Who told you that, huh?

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:02.030
I heard people talking.

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:03.430
Or they were joking me?

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
No.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:06.230
It is true.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.680
Sol! When did you come back?

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:16.230
Just now.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.190
Hello. Hello. Hello.

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:20.190
No need to do that.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:26.760
C'mon!

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.470
You, shithead Sol!

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.960
I thought you were gonna leave us for good.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:34.960
Asshole!

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:37.030
I just finished my tour.

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:38.840
So I wanted to come back to rest.

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:41.800
How are you, Sol? Did you get to to meet Lisa and Bambam?

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.000
I gotta rehearse a lot.
So much work to be done, so I didn't get to see anyone.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:45.150
I'll be coming home late tonight. Don't wait up.

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:46.030
A celeb!

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.030
Hey, wait!

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.390
Let me take a selfie.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.350
Actually, this is for my wife.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.030
Smile!

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:56.030
My wife, she's the president of your fandom.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:04.560
And tonight, we're gonna be partying till late.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.800
Therefore, tomorrow, for you all...

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.270
No rehearsal, no coming into the office. I give you all one day off.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.800
Whoa! That's amazing!

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.680
Bring it, bring it?

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:15.270
C'mon. Bottoms up!

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.470
Sol just came back, so you guys talk to him.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:20.350
Ask him anything. I'm so excited now. He's celebrity.

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:30.110
Oh.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.840
Are you still mad at me?

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.680
Huh?

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:57.230
Oh, no.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.430
Why would I be mad at you? It's been a long time.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.760
I forgot all about it.

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.350
But I still remember,

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.640
everything you did for me.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.840
But I was still really young,

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:16.150
So I thought...

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:19.920
What?

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.800
You thought I went to you just to get you into my bed?

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:28.470
It's not your fault.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.560
We all know that in this industry, there are lots who take advantages.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.960
But now I know that you're not like that.

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:40.350
Sol,

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:43.230
I have never been mad at you.

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:46.350
Do you know that you're the pride of our team.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.190
Here, let me tell you this.

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:54.230
Your music videos, I've seen them all.

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:56.110
I can dance to every song.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.520
You wanna see it? You want me to dance to a few songs?

00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.520
Maybe two songs.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:01.840
You should stop me.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.920
You know I can't dance. What shall I do?

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.720
Right, Joe.

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:08.800
Huh?

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:13.070
The actual reason I returned isn't only because of work.

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:19.110
I miss you.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:28.390
You two, what are you doing here?

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.000
The rest and I are waiting for you guys inside.

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:35.920
Don't ruin the party.
I'd like to ask you two back to the drunk group.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:38.110
Let's party. Let's go!

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:39.350
- Drag me.
- Not drunk yet.

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:41.230
Whoops, I open the wrong side.

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:31.310
Joe, you're home now.

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:32.470
Where is the key?

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:34.150
The key...

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000
is under the tree pot.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:40.840
Okay.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.880
Who are you?

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:22.470
And who are you?

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:27.270
I'm Joe's close junior.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.190
Today, we went to celebrate.

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:31.190
Joe was drunken by his boss.

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:37.150
Thanks.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.960
I'll take it from here.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:49.110
Joe.

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:55.150
Ming.

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:58.310
Ming.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:02.960
Don't worry.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.680
I'll take a really good care of him.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:52.880
Ming.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.520
Why am I lying here?

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:02.720
You stank of alcohol. The floor suits you.

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:12.310
And who dropped me off last night?

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:15.470
I don't remember anything. Was it Wut?

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:19.310
A lot more handsome than that.

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:27.920
Oh, Sol?

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.920
Before, he used to be in my team.

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:33.030
But now, he's an idol in Korea.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.720
Well, it was kind of him to drop you off here.

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:44.150
If I hadn't been here last night,

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:46.150
I guess you would've used the condom.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:55.800
What's wrong with you, Ming? Huh?

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Are you jealous?

00:33:58.960 --> 00:33:59.960
Who's jealous?

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:02.920
If you're not jealous, then why would you be mad?

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:05.560
Talk nicely.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.560
What's in you to make me jealous?

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:16.679
I'm sorry.

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:22.469
Don't be so full of yourself.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.920
You're just a stand-in.

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:53.389
Sit-ups break my back; love breaks my heart.

00:34:56.429 --> 00:34:57.430
What?

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:02.430
Good!

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.350
Keep doing exercise;

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:08.350
broken hearts won't break you.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:11.520
Great.

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:34.190
The number you've dialed cannot be connected right now.

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:36.190
Please leave a message.

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:43.390
Why has Joe been having so many mood swings lately?

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:12.310
Oh, Ming.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:13.600
Are you hungry?

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:15.920
I'll make something for you.

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.720
It's alright, sis. I've made it myself.

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:23.150
Hey, you've learned how to eat like this, mister?

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.600
Before, if it's not Michelin-starred, you wouldn't touch it.

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:28.310
You're exaggerating.

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.520
What's wrong?

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:38.270
Did you fight with Mom? Why are you here?

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000
No.

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:41.640
I'm just bored.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.800
Wanna take a trip?

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:46.560
I'll invite Tong, your beloved, along.

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:52.350
Sis.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.880
Today, I wanna be with you, just only the two of us.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:09.350
Then...I'll grab some chocolate.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.230
And then we'll lie here and watch cartoon, how does that sound?

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.270
We're not kids anymore.

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:42.270
Can we switch?

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:43.720
No.

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.800
It's dripping.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:47.110
Yum.

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:48.110
It's still in my mouth.

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:50.430
Is it good?

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:51.390
Yeah.

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:55.390
How long haven't we both chilled like this?

00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:58.840
Well, who told you to get a boyfriend?

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:01.230
I can't help it. I'm pretty.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.760
Seeing this reminds me of when we were kids.

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:17.030
If I hadn't been so stubborn and got
into the water alone like that,

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.720
you wouldn't have had to be so troubled.

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:21.150
Who said so?

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:24.150
If I didn't help you that day...

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.680
now...

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:29.720
I wouldn't have this stubborn baby brother right beside me.

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.190
Don't overthink.

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.720
In exchange of a pneumonia,

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:37.350
it's worth it.

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:43.000
Sis,

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:45.720
when I'm not around,

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:46.960
are you happy?

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:48.560
Very happy.

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:51.110
I don't have headaches.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.470
But I also am very lonely.

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:56.270
Lonely? You got Tong.

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:58.800
It's not the same, is it?

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:03.310
For me, family is the most important thing.

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:10.030
Yes, it is.

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:13.190
Family is the most important thing.

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:15.520
And how about you,

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:18.270
Ming? Are you happy?

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.390
When I see you happy,

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:24.390
I'm happy.

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.960
No, that's not it.

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:27.520
You gotta find happiness

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:30.350
for yourself too, Ming.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.760
Sometimes, it's hard to do.

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:38.030
Even I can, I shouldn't.

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:42.960
If you got something on your mind,

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:48.470
you can come to me for advice at any time.

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:51.150
Understood?

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:55.960
I'm always on your side.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.680
I know that.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.760
But this one, it may take some time.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.030
I promise you...

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.600
that I'll get through this.

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:38.030
So, we've trained for months, and this is all you got?

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:39.270
Get up

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:40.680
and do it again!

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:41.600
Hurry!

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.600
Joe, someone's here to see you.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.350
Oh, Sol.

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:49.920
You're still as uptight as before.

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.680
If I wasn't strict...

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.390
would I be able to push you to Korea?

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.150
I was there for a long time...

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:59.000
I don't know if I can still remember what you taught me.

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:01.470
I guess it's time for a brush-up.

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:03.030
Sol, I was kidding.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.680
You are not a stuntman anymore.

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:07.230
What?

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.000
You're afraid of losing?

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:13.520
If something happens to you, Wut will kill me.

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:19.350
If you're not serious with this, I'll take you down.

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:33.640
Alright, Sol.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:36.840
Sol.

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:39.070
Sol.

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:41.680
Hey, Sol!

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:44.070
Sol! Sol! Sol! Sol! Sol!

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.640
Wut will definitely kill me.

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.560
I'm really alright now.

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:55.720
What were you thinking?

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.560
I just wanted us to be like what we used to be.

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:15.230
Sol, you're a millions-viewer superstar now.

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.600
Why would you come back and get yourself hurt like this?

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:23.270
When I was there, people came to me,...

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.310
expecting something out of me...

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:30.030
I realized that...

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:32.030
only you were sincere to me.

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:48.470
I was foolish.

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:51.110
I was being paranoid.

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:53.230
And I ran away from you.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.680
Can you give me one more chance?

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:02.760
What are you talking about? Huh?

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:06.760
No matter what, you will always be like my dear brother, you know.

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.560
But I don't want to be just a brother.

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:14.230
I don't want to be a friend.

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:21.030
I want us to be a couple.

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.720
I admit that I used to like you.

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:33.000
You were really cool.

00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:40.350
But when time passed,

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:43.560
I started to realize...

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:45.920
what love really was.

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.760
It's like that someone...

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:55.760
makes you feel like you're home.

00:44:57.470 --> 00:45:00.070
It's someone who can make you feel lonely,

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:02.680
although you can live alone by yourself.

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:08.150
You mean...

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.520
your boyfriend who's at your place?

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:18.600
Yeah.

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.600
Actually, he's not my boyfriend.

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:27.430
Even though, I want us to be a couple so badly.

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:50.390
I should've come back sooner...

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:34.640
Ming.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.600
Oh, you're back?

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.600
How did you get in?

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:45.190
The key under the tree pot.

00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:48.470
Oh.

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:51.880
What's that smell?

00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:58.070
I tried making curry rice with deep-fried pork.

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.800
I know it might not be as tasty as what you do.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.880
I meant...the burning smell.

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:10.430
Curry!

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:12.270
It's burnt?!

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:17.190
Is it hot? I'm sorry.

00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:18.190
It's alright, it's alright.

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.840
Damn it.

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:21.840
Are you okay?

00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:40.270
I've opened a window already.

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:43.310
The smell will be gone soon.

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:47.560
I'm sorry.

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:49.150
It's alright.

00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:01.270
You know, my parents passed away when I was little.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:03.840
So I grew up alone.

00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:09.350
And my dream was...

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:13.350
seeing lights on when I came home.

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:17.110
And the lovely smell of the food.

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:21.110
And someone...to say, "You're home?".

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:25.270
Thank you, Ming, for making my dream come true.

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:33.110
If you like it, make a copy of the key for me.

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.190
I'm too lazy to lift the tree pot.

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.800
Wait, what do you mean?

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:39.880
Oh.

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:44.110
Weren't you the one inviting me in the other day?

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:47.070
Are you really moving in with me?

00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:47.880
Huh, for real?

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:51.230
or real?

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.760
But I got two conditions.

00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:55.390
What are those?

00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:00.600
First, we won't mess with the other one's privacy.

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:02.430
Okay.

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:03.880
And the second one?

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:05.840
The second one...

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.560
you can't mess with other people.

00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:11.390
Especially, that oppa of yours.

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:12.960
Can you do it?

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:16.350
Of course, I can accept any of your conditions.

00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:20.350
All I want is that when I come home, I see you.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000
And...that night, were you jealous?

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
If you ask again, I'll change my mind.

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:40.070
Well, I wanna hear it.

00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:42.470
Tell me, were you jealous?

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:44.070
Were you?

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:46.760
Mmm.

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:48.760
Huh? What was that? I couldn't hear you.

00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:50.310
I've already said it.

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:53.000
- I didn't hear it. I wanna hear it.
- I said it.

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:55.800
- I wanna hear it again. Please. Were you jealous?
- No.

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:57.000
Please.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Just eat it!

00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:12.560
What?

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:13.960
What's wrong with you?

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:26.640
What are you doing?

00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:28.430
No!

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:29.960
Ming!

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:34.840
Give it to me, I'll do it.

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:36.150
- Again!
- No!

00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:37.270
Come on, hurry up!

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:38.920
Do it yourself!

00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:41.190
- I want to do it again.
- No!

00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:43.390
If I can make a wish,

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:46.470
I wish that this night

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.680
will last forever.

00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:54.310
It's a pity. It wasn't possible.

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.390
- Eat it yourself!
- No! I want it like earlier.

00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:57.640
No more!

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:03.520
Isn't that too short?

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:06.640
No!
